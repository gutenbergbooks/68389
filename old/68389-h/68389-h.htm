PREFATORY NOTE
</p>

<p>
As the long struggle between Maori and Pakeha
dragged to a close, a new interest was given to it
by the perversion of numbers of Maoris of various
tribes to a singular religion, styled by its founders
<i>Pai Marire</i>&mdash;that is, 'good and peaceful.'
</p>

<p>
There was nothing good or peaceful about the
new religion, which was a fantastic blend of very
elementary Christianity, Judaism and Paganism.
Deadly hostility to the Pakeha, or white man, was
an all-important item in this curious creed, whose
votaries were known as Hau-haus, and prominent
amongst its prophets was the rebel chief, Te Kooti,
one of the best generals and one of the worst men
of his day.
</p>

<p>
Brave, ferocious and animated by an almost
oriental fatalism, the Hau-haus were formidable
antagonists and, moreover, shocked even their
compatriots by their ruthless savagery.  At the
very outset they defeated a mixed contingent of the
57th Regiment and Colonials at Taranaki, and cut
off the head of Captain Lloyd, who had been killed
in action.  Lloyd's head, preserved after the Maori
fashion, was then carried round from tribe to tribe
by two Hau-hau missionaries, who strove to make
converts to the new faith.  When they succeeded,
the head was spiked upon the summit of the <i>niu</i>,
or sacred pole, round which the fanatics leaped and
danced until they grew frenzied, uttering at frequent
intervals their characteristic barking howl,
'Hau-hau!  Hau-hau!' which has been described as the
most frightful of noises, and a trial to the nerves
of the bravest.
</p>

<p>
While in no sense a history of a particular period
of the war, the story is built upon a historical basis.
Thus, the imprisonment of Te Kooti on Chatham
Island&mdash;according to some upon a fabricated charge&mdash;his
escape thence in a brig, the sacrifice of his aged
uncle in order to propitiate the wind-god, his landing
near Poverty Bay, the massacre there, the fight at
Paparatu and the final storming of a strong <i>pah</i> in
which he had taken refuge, are all matters of history.
Te Kooti, however, did not massacre the crew of the
brig, nor was he slain in battle.  Like the yet more
infamous Nana Sahib, he escaped to be no more
heard of.  It is interesting to note that a nephew
of Te Kooti appeared a few months ago in New
Zealand, threatening to preach a new religion and
to bring about the downfall of the Pakeha.
</p>

<p>
The <i>mere</i>[<a id="chap00fn1text"></a><a href="#chap00fn1">1</a>] (pronounced almost as 'merry') or
war-club of the Maoris was in shape something like an
old-fashioned soda-water bottle, flattened, and was
made of wood, bone, a very hard gray stone, whalebone,
jade, or of the valuable mineral, nephrite, more
commonly known as 'greenstone,' which is found in
the Middle Island.  The Maoris regarded the
greenstone with superstitious veneration, and in times
of danger would sacrifice their ornaments fashioned
from it to the particular god whose aid it was
desired to invoke.  Greenstone clubs were the
peculiar possessions of chiefs or very important
tribesmen, inferior mortals contenting themselves
with those of less costly materials.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap00fn1"></a>
[<a href="#chap00fn1text">1</a>] In Maori every letter is pronounced.  Thus: <i>whare</i>, a
house = 'wharry,' not 'whar.'
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Regarding the particular greenstone club which
figures so prominently in the story, it is, perhaps,
only fair to admit that it will be useless for readers
with archæological tastes to endeavour to verify
the tradition of its origin or the sinister prophecy
attached to it.
</p>

<p>
While I took no part in the struggle, I well
remember, when a very little boy, adding my small
voice to the enthusiastic cheers of the people as
first one regiment and, later on, another, marched
through the streets of Sydney on their way to
embark for New Zealand.  When several sizes larger,
it was my fortune to see much of the native races
of the southern seas&mdash;in Maori-land, Fiji, the Loyalty
Islands, and elsewhere.  Now if I can succeed in
interesting my readers by picturing for them some
of the scenes which filled my childhood with so much
colour and interest and delight, I shall be satisfied.

<h3>
CHAPTER I
<br /><br />
FAMILY JARS
</h3>

<p>
The long-drawn, melancholy wail of the curlew rose
and fell thrice in the garden, and Terence Moore
went to the window and looked out into the clear
moonlight.
</p>

<p>
'Is that you, George?' he hailed.
</p>

<p>
'Yes.  Come out quietly; I want to talk to you.'
</p>

<p>
Terence hung by his hands from the sill and dropped
to the ground beside his visitor.  'What is the matter,
George?' he inquired anxiously.  'Why won't you
come in?'
</p>

<p>
'Because I wish to see you alone, and I don't want
any one to know that I am here.  You may as well
hear it first as last, old fellow&mdash;I have left home.'
</p>

<p>
'I am not surprised.  My only wonder is that you
have stayed there so long,' Terence commented,
lifting his tip-tilted nose still higher.
</p>

<p>
'Things have come to a head, you see,' explained
George Haughton.  'The colonel struck me this
evening, and though, of course, I don't mind that,
yet I can't stand any longer the sort of life I have
been forced to lead for the past year or two.'
</p>

<p>
'I am not surprised,' repeated Terence.  'Few
fellows would have been as patient, I think.  Wait
a moment and I'll get my hat.'
</p>

<p>
He was back again almost immediately, and, linking
arms with George, drew him round the house to
the front gate.
</p>

<p>
These two had been friends from earliest childhood,
though both in appearance and disposition they
differed remarkably from one another.  George
Haughton, tall and commanding, finely made, with
well-knit, muscular frame, fair, curling hair, and
Saxon-blue eyes, was the very type of a healthy
young Englishman.  The other, Terence Moore, was
blue-eyed also; but his shock of red hair, his densely
freckled skin, the tilt of his nose, and his wide
smiling mouth as plainly betrayed his Irish origin
as did his name.  He was much shorter than George,
but his broad shoulders and extraordinary length of
arm amply atoned for any deficiency in the matter
of inches.
</p>

<p>
Terence was a bushman to his finger-tips, and once
had been heir to a fine estate, but on the death of
his father, two years before the opening of this
story, he had been left penniless.  Mrs. Moore had
died when her boy was but an infant, and so it
happened that the lad lost parent, money and home
at one stroke, for the creditors seized his father's
station, along with everything upon it which could
be turned into cash.
</p>

<p>
Young Moore, then only eighteen, had not money
enough to take up land and develop a new station,
and though his dear friends, the Haughtons, would
have helped him to any extent, he was too proud to
become dependent, even upon them.  So he started
driving fat cattle from one part of the country to
another, an occupation at once profitable and healthy.
In the intervals of work he stayed in Sydney with
his mother's sister; and thus securing the companionship
of George Haughton, proceeded to make the
latter still more discontented with his lot, by pouring
into his ear all the moving incidents by flood and
field which fall to the share of the gentleman-drover.
</p>

<p>
To this sympathetic friend did George now confide
the tale of the crisis of his long dispute with his
father, to which Terence, anxious to secure a
congenial companion during his long rides through the
bush, replied by an earnest appeal to George to
throw in his lot with his own.
</p>

<p>
As a matter of fact, there had been a terrible scene
at 'Sobraon.'  For two years Colonel Haughton had
fumed and fretted at his son's evident disinclination
to follow the path marked out for him, and to-day
a climax had been reached.  The colonel, enraged at
George's invincible opposition, had lost command of
himself and struck his son; and the way in which it
all came about was this:
</p>

<p>
After the famous battle of Sobraon, in which he
was severely wounded, Colonel Haughton had retired
from the army and bought a beautiful property on
the wooded heights of one of the tiny bays which
break the noble outline of Sydney Harbour.  Here
he had settled with his wife and his son, George, then
a burly little fellow of three, whose obvious destiny
was the army, in which his father had served with
such distinction.  But after the lad's tenth birthday
the colonel's views underwent a change, and it
was decided to send the youngster into the bush, so
that he might grow familiar with station life, and
in due course become capable of managing the
fine run which his father intended to purchase for
him.
</p>

<p>
This was much more to George's taste than school,
and six months with his father's old friend, Major
Moore, went far towards making a thorough little
bushman of him.  Terence and he were already
chums, and the constant association which continued
during their youth cemented a friendship which
endured throughout their lives.
</p>

<p>
The colonel's 'system,' thus inaugurated, was
further developed by a visit to New Zealand, where
George's uncle, Captain Haughton, R.N., retired,
had settled some years before.  Thereafter Colonel
Haughton divided each successive year into four
parts, every three months of study alternating with
a like period in the bush, either with Major Moore in
New South Wales, or with Captain Haughton in
New Zealand, as the turn of each came round.
</p>

<p>
Brain and body developed most satisfactorily
under this system, and, as a natural consequence of
so much healthy outdoor life, George at nineteen was
as sturdy and well-developed a youngster as could
be found, while in height he already over-topped his
father, who stood five feet eleven outside his boots.
The boy's future seemed splendidly assured, when a
season of drought, common enough in Australia,
frightened the colonel, and, after much deliberation,
he astounded everybody by declaring his intention
to launch his son in business.
</p>

<p>
But here he reckoned without George, for nothing
less suited to the lad's disposition, tastes or early
training could have been hit upon, and the one thing
which kept him from open rebellion was his desire
not to give pain to his mother.  But when, quite
suddenly, Mrs. Haughton died, George, who had
been devoted to her&mdash;though he had a great admiration
and love for his father, too&mdash;determined to resist
the proposed change with all his might.
</p>

<p>
He said little, however, until his twentieth birthday
was passed, though his attitude was always one
of firm, respectful opposition; and then at last the
crisis came, and the blow struck by the hasty-tempered
father in support of his authority broke down
the last lingering scruple on the part of his son.  It
is difficult, all facts considered, to blame George too
severely, even if his conduct in taking the law into
his own hands cannot be entirely excused.
</p>

<p>
'You can't do better than come with me, George,'
urged the wily Terence, when George had told him
of the tempestuous scene at 'Sobraon,' as Colonel
Haughton had named his house.  'You can't do
better,' he repeated; 'that is, if you have made up
your mind not to return home.'
</p>

<p>
'That is decided,' said George.  'To go back would
only mean further hopeless bickering with my father,
and I don't want to run any risks.'
</p>

<p>
'Then that is settled.  You will have to lie low for
a week or so until I am on the move again; but you
can write to your father and let him know that you
are safe.  I dare say he will come round as soon as
he sees that you are really in earnest.  He is a good
sort, is the colonel,' wound up Terence, with a grin
at the recollection of a sound thrashing his old friend
had once given him.
</p>

<p>
'He is, I admit,' granted the colonel's wayward
son.  'All the same, he won't come round easily.  He
would wear out my will by sheer persistence and get
his own way if I remained in the house.  My only
safety lies in flight.'
</p>

<p>
'I believe you.  And you will fly with me to the
bush.'
</p>

<p>
'No, Terence; I have another plan.'  And straightway
George delivered himself of a statement which
astonished his voluble friend into something like
absolute silence.  But this did not last very long.
For a few moments Terence remained pensive, his
thoughts evidently far away; then, as they turned to
take the homeward road he astonished George in
his turn by cutting a caper in the middle of the
street.
</p>

<p>
'Hurroo!' he cried, relapsing into the rich brogue
he could assume at pleasure, and poured out a torrent
of strange sounds, which George declared to be
gibberish, but which Terence insisted were 'the rale
Oirish for unbounded deloight.'
</p>

<p>
'But what is the matter with you?' George asked
helplessly at last.  'Why should you behave like a
lunatic because I am going away?'
</p>

<p>
'Because <i>we</i> are going, if you please,' corrected
Terence, suddenly serious.
</p>

<p>
George stared at him.  'You don't mean that you
are coming, too?'
</p>

<p>
'An' why wouldn't I?  Do you think I'll allow a
great baby like you to go off alone among all those
murtherin' ruffians?  Yes,' he concluded, with a mock
salute, 'with your leave, or without your leave, I'm
going with you.'
</p>

<p>
'But&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash;' began George in stammering protest.
</p>

<p>
'No buts, old fellow.  I am going with you,'
declared Terence; 'so there is no more to be said.'
</p>

<p>
'But your prospects?' objected George.
</p>

<p>
'Oh yes, my prospects.  Fine, aren't they?  I shall
have quite as good a chance of getting on in the
world&mdash;and a better&mdash;by going with you, as I shall
by jogging peacefully behind a lot of fat cattle.
Besides, we are not going away for ever, I hope;
and I know plenty of people who will be only too
glad to get me to drive their beasts, no matter how
long I may stay away.  So say no more about it; the
thing is settled.'
</p>

<p>
'You are a good friend, Terence,' said George, with
some emotion, and the two linked arms once more
and set off in the direction of Woolloomooloo, where
Terence resided when in town.
</p>

<p class="t3">

<p>
<i>Midnight!</i>  The solemn strokes of some big clock
in the city boomed over the quiet waters of the bay,
and the two soldierly old men who were standing on
the little jetty at the foot of the garden at 'Sobraon'
turned rather helplessly towards one another.
</p>

<p>
'We may as well go in, Charles,' said the elder,
who was Colonel Haughton's brother-in-law, General
Cantor.  He will not return to-night, I feel sure.'  To
himself he added: 'I don't believe he means to return
at all, poor lad.'  For General Cantor had been to a
large extent in his nephew's confidence, and had long
ago made up his mind that George would one day
end the constant friction by a sudden snapping of
home ties.
</p>

<p>
'I dare say you are right, William,' the colonel
answered, too depressed to argue; 'yet he often pulls
home across the bay at night.  Well, well; I have
been a tyrant and a fool.  I see that
{missing words} pray God not too late.'  There was a
{missing words} voice, and he turned about to cast one more look
over the shimmering sea.  'God bless the boy, wherever
he is, whatever he does,' he murmured, and,
leaning heavily upon his upright little brother-in-law,
went back to the house.
</p>

<p>
There they wished one another good-night rather
tremulously; but the colonel set the French-window
of his son's room ajar, and with a prayer in his
sorrowful heart for the absent lad went
thoughtfully to bed.
</p>

<p>
The first streak of morning found him again in
George's room, looking eagerly for some sign of his
presence.  George was not there, but the window had
been shut, and a letter lay conspicuously upon a
table.  The colonel caught it up and tore it open with
trembling fingers.  A glance gave him a grasp of the
contents, and with a bitter cry he flung himself upon
his knees by the empty bed and poured out his heart
in prayer that no harm might come to the son whom
he loved so well and had used so hardly.
</p>

<p>
The letter ran:
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
'MY DEAR FATHER,&mdash;I think that it is wiser for me
to leave home for a time and strike out a line for
myself.  It grieves me to oppose you, but, as I feel
myself to be utterly unfitted for a commercial life,
there is nothing else to be done.  We used to be such
(missing words} and we have neither of us been
very happy since mother died.  Don't imagine that I
am going away because of our little breeze to-day.  I
have not thought of that again.  Really, I have not.
I shall write as soon as I have settled to the work I
have chosen, and will keep you posted as to my
movements.  Good-bye, my dear old dad.  My love to
Uncle William; and you may both of you be sure
that I shall try and remember your teaching and his
and keep straight.  I am afraid you will say that I
am making a crooked beginning; but, father, in this
matter I can't obey you.  I can't indeed.  Good-bye
again.  Try to remember me as your affectionate son,
</p>

<p class="noindent">
GEORGE.'
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
And this was almost the last that Colonel Haughton
heard of his son for many a day.

<h3>
CHAPTER II
<br /><br />
THE QUEEN'S SHILLING SUNDERS FRIENDS
</h3>

<p>
Down the South Head Road, down the long, narrow
length of George Street, headed by its splendid band,
swept the famous regiment, a glittering streak of
scarlet and steel; and all the way from Paddington
Barracks to the great wharf at the Circular Quay,
where lay the waiting transport, the people cheered
themselves hoarse, waving banners and scattering
flowers under the marching feet.  For the gallant
600th were going to New Zealand&mdash;going to the war.
</p>

<p>
Everywhere was orderly bustle as the men embarked,
and no one found time to heed the behaviour
of two young civilians, who had managed to get on
board, and who at once made a hurried descent into
the darkest corner of the forehatch; nor did they
emerge even when the noisy bell clanged out a
warning to those who belonged to the shore to make all
haste and get there.
</p>

<p>
The transport, led by a proud little tug, was passing
Farm Cove, the beautiful anchorage for ships of
the naval squadron, which fronts the ornamental
grounds of Government House, when the disciplined
quiet of the frigate was disturbed by an outcry in the
neighbourhood of the fo'c'sle, and Sergeant-major
Horn, hurrying to ascertain the cause, was met, to
his great surprise, by a couple of his men, who haled
between them a pair of dishevelled youths.
</p>

<p>
'Silence, you there!' commanded the sergeant-major
sternly.  Then to George and Terence&mdash;for
they, indeed, were the stowaways: 'What's the
meaning of this?  Who are you?  Where do you come
from?  What brought you here?'  His quick eye
at once discerned that the young men he addressed
were not of the same class as those who detained
them.
</p>

<p>
George had not reckoned upon being compelled to
make a public declaration.  He had looked for a
quiet word with the sergeant-major, whom he hoped
to win to his side.  Consequently, he was for a
moment at a loss; but, while he was framing a reply,
Terence, with a comical glance at the men, struck in,
employing his richest brogue.
</p>

<p>
'Aw!  Sargint, darlin', listen to me, now.  We're
gintlemin out av work.  We've come out of two
dir-r-rty barr'ls in the forehatch.  We wor brought
here be the boys in rid.  And as to the manin' av ut
all, why, I'll tell ye that, too, so I will; but only in
your own ear, me jool.'
</p>

<p>
'None of your impudence, now,' quoth Horn darkly,
and scowled at the men, who were grinning broadly
at Terence's absurd appearance.  For his shock of
red hair was more tousled than ever, and the assumed
simplicity of his expression would, according to one
of the men, have made a cat laugh.
</p>

<p>
'Luk at that, now!' cried Terence, deftly shifting
the burden of reproof from his own shoulders.  'B'ys,
I wonder at ye, so I do, laughin' at your shuparior
offisher an' all'; which was too much for the men,
who sent back a storm of chaff.
</p>

<p>
'Silence!' roared Horn, 'Now then, you two, give
an account of yourselves, or over the side you go.'
</p>

<p>
Terence had no intention of allowing his sense of
fun to spoil their chance, so he shot a look at
George, who replied quietly: 'We came on board,
hoping that you would see your way to enlist us
in the regiment.'
</p>

<p>
'Oh!  I thought you might be trying to snatch a
passage to New Zealand,' returned Horn, inwardly
admiring the splendid physique of the speaker, with
whose features he was vaguely familiar.  'If to enlist
is your game, why didn't you come up to the barracks
yesterday, instead of sneaking on board like this?'
</p>

<p>
The pair flushed at this offensive way of putting it;
but George could hardly admit that they had avoided
the barracks for fear of being recognised, since many
of the officers were personal friends of his father and
himself, and all were on visiting terms at his home.
So he replied simply: 'The truth is, it was quite
impossible for us to enlist yesterday.'
</p>

<p>
Horn was puzzled.  The couple in front of him were
fine specimens of physical manhood, but what they
asked for smacked strongly of irregularity.  Besides,
they might have been up to some mischief, and he
did not wish to incur a responsibility which might
get him into more or less serious trouble.  But he
wanted these two likely fellows; so he determined to
speak to the adjutant about them.
</p>

<p>
But George read his thoughts, and, unobtrusively
slipping a sovereign into his hand, said in a low voice:
'Don't report the matter just yet, Sergeant-major.
We don't want to run any risk of being stopped.'
</p>

<p>
Horn took another good look at them as he deftly
pouched the gold.  'No,' said he; 'I don't believe
that either of you would play a dirty trick.  I'll
chance it, though I expect there'll  be a row.  Line
up here.'
</p>

<p>
George was radiant.  He shook Terence heartily by
the hand, and in so doing shifted his position so as to
bring his friend opposite to the sergeant-major, who
very naturally addressed him first, putting several
questions to him, all of which Terence answered in
his own humorous fashion.
</p>

<p>
'I'll get even with you presently, my fine fellow,'
said Horn dryly, and finally inquired: 'Do you join of
your own free will, being sober, and not under
compulsion?'
</p>

<p>
'Sober!' echoed Terence, to the huge delight of his
audience.  'Why, I'm as dhry as a cow widout a
calf; and as to compulsion&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'None of your lip,' cut in Horn, handing him a
shilling with the verbal bonus: 'And now look here,
young shaver, if I have any more of your cheek,
you'll begin your military career in the punishment
cells on bread and water.  So now you know.'
</p>

<p>
The look which accompanied these harsh-sounding
words was genial enough, and Terence had the wit
to understand the hint conveyed, namely, that he
now belonged to a disciplined body, whose dealings
with their superiors were very nicely regulated.
</p>

<p>
'Now then, you,' said Horn to George.  'What's
your name?'
</p>

<p>
Confident that before he had been many hours a
soldier some of the officers would be sure to recognise
him, George thought it useless to assume a <i>nom de
guerre</i>.  So he answered in a clear voice, 'George
Haughton.'
</p>

<p>
'George Haughton!' sounded like an echo behind
him.  'So it is!  And what brings you here, George?'
</p>

<p>
And at the sound of that too-familiar voice, which
he recognised as that of his father's old friend, Colonel
Cranstoun, commanding the 600th, George realised
with bitter disappointment that his chance of taking
the Queen's shilling that day was as good as gone.
</p>

<p>
Colonel Cranstoun had watched the scene on the
foredeck under the impression that the sergeant-major
was interrogating a couple of stowaways,
but when he saw the pair line up, he suspected some
irregularity, and hastened to investigate the matter.
He was short-sighted, so that it was not until he
neared the group that he was struck by something
familiar in the appearance of the two young men;
but, as he came up behind them, it was only when
he heard George's name that he realised, to his
unbounded surprise, that the would-be recruit was the
son of his old friend and sword-brother, Colonel
Haughton.
</p>

<p>
'What on earth are you doing here, George?'
repeated the amazed chief, as the men fell back
respectfully.
</p>

<p>
'I was just going to enlist, sir,' George answered
quietly, though inwardly he was raging.
</p>

<p>
'Oh!  Were you indeed?' said Colonel Cranstoun
dryly.  'And Mr. Moore?  Does he, too, wish to
enlist?'
</p>

<p>
'Begging your pardon, sir,' put in Horn, saluting,
'he has this moment enlisted.'
</p>

<p>
Colonel Cranstoun looked deeply annoyed.  'Who
authorised you to turn the fore-deck into a recruiting
depot?' he demanded sternly of Horn, who cast an
imploring look at George.
</p>

<p>
'It was my fault, Colonel,' interposed George at
once, adding naïvely, 'I was afraid that if you knew
you would prevent us.'
</p>

<p>
Under pretence of giving his moustache a twist,
Colonel Cranstoun hid a smile behind his hand.
'Follow me to my cabin, George,' he said, and, curtly
returning the dejected Horn's salute, walked off,
followed by George, who felt decidedly cheap.
</p>

<p>
Terence, left behind, looked after his friend with
an air of comical resignation, and inquired of the
sergeant-major in a dolorous whine: 'Aw, sergeant
dear, can I offer you a guinea to take back the shilling
I had of you just now?'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, dry up!' snapped the disgusted Horn.  'Why
couldn't you say you knew the colonel?  I'll get my
head blown off.  But how was I to know?  <i>You're</i>
booked anyhow,' he wound up, with a snarl.
</p>

<p>
'Faith, 'tis cooked as well as booked I am,' sighed
Terence.  'He'll never let George enlist, and then
what will I do at all, at all?'
</p>

<p>
'Take him out of this!' vociferated Horn.  'No;
let him stay.  The colonel may want him when he's
done with that other lump of mischief.'  He stalked
off in high dudgeon.
</p>

<p>
Meantime Colonel Cranstoun had shut himself in
his cabin with George.  'Tell me the meaning of all
this, my boy,' he said kindly.  'Is it a case of bolt?'
</p>

<p>
George nodded gloomily; then burst out with impetuous
pleading: 'Don't ask me to go back, Colonel
Cranstoun, for I can't and I won't.'
</p>

<p>
'Let me hear your story,' said the colonel; and as
briefly as possible George gave him the details of his
difference with his father.  When he had finished,
Colonel Cranstoun laid a hand upon his shoulder.
</p>

<p>
'It must be clear to you, George, that I cannot
countenance this escapade.  What should I say to
my old friend&mdash;if we ever meet again&mdash;were I to
allow his son to do a foolish thing, and put forth no
hand to save him from his folly?'
</p>

<p>
One glance at the fine, inflexible face told George
that pleading would be thrown away; so he said as
quietly as he could: 'Very good, sir.  I would rather
serve under you than under any one; but since you
won't have me, I shall enlist as soon as we reach New
Zealand.'
</p>

<p>
'You are not going there in this ship,' the colonel
said curtly.
</p>

<p>
This was a facer, and George caught his breath.
He had reckoned without his host.  He had a
sickening sense of what was coming.
</p>

<p>
'Now, George, you know your duty as well as I do,'
went on the colonel.  'Make your father understand
that you can't adopt the&mdash;er&mdash;profession he has in
view for you&mdash;I don't blame you for that; quite the
contrary&mdash;but don't try to persuade yourself that
you are doing anything heroic in running away
from home like a schoolboy.'
</p>

<p>
'Well, sir,' answered George in his quietest manner,
'if I can't go in this ship, I will in another.'
</p>

<p>
Colonel Cranstoun's gesture indicated impatience.
'I must inspect the men before we pass the Heads,'
he said.  'Listen to me, George.  I am going to send
you back in the tug; but I want you to promise me
that when you reach Sydney you will go straight
home.'
</p>

<p>
'No, sir; I will make no such promise.'
</p>

<p>
The colonel's temper departed with startling
suddenness.  'You obstinate young dog!' he roared.  'I
don't wonder your father thrashed you.  Give me
your promise, or I'll have you clapped in irons and
handed over to the master of the tug.'
</p>

<p>
'I shall make no promise, whatever you do,' retorted
George.
</p>

<p>
'Then make none, and be hanged to you!' snapped
the colonel.  'I shall know how to deal with you.
Dash it, sir! don't imagine that you can play fast
and loose with me.'
</p>

<p>
He flung out of the cabin in a royal rage; but
George was at the door before he could close it.
'What about Terence, sir?  He only enlisted because
he believed that I should do so, too&mdash;as I most
certainly should have done, had not you, unfortunately,
put in an appearance when you were least wanted.'
</p>

<p>
The remark was unfortunate, at all events, and
there was a wicked gleam in the colonel's eye as he
said relentlessly: 'Your friend has taken the Queen's
shilling, sir, and I shall make it my business to see
that Her Majesty gets value for her money.  I'll  not
interfere.'
</p>

<p>
He did not tell George that, owing to the irregularity
of the whole proceeding, he could, as colonel,
have quashed the enlistment with a word.  'Besides,'
he went on, 'I suspect that young Moore has been
leading you into mischief, and I dare say your father
will thank me for taking him out of your way for
a time.  What, sir?  Not a word!  No; I'll not hear
another word.'
</p>

<p>
'Yes; you shall hear just one,' cried George, now
in a rage on his part.  'It is most unjust of you to
revenge yourself upon my innocent friend, and to
accuse him in this monstrous fashion because I won't
give in to you.  But whatever you do'&mdash;he laughed
defiantly&mdash;'I'll get to New Zealand in spite of you.'
</p>

<p>
The colonel glared at him; but George met him
eye to eye, and presently, age and experience gaining
the upper hand, Colonel Cranstoun marched out of
the cabin with a dignity which somehow made
George feel small.  In a quarter of an hour he was
back again, saying, as if nothing had happened: 'The
tug is ready, George.  I take it that you will give me
the promise I asked for.'
</p>

<p>
'No, sir; I can't do that,' George answered
respectfully; 'but I beg your pardon for the manner in
which I spoke to you just now.'  Then he fell in
behind the colonel and marched to the side, where
he found that the old warrior had so far relented as
to allow Terence to stand by to bid him adieu.  Some
of the men giggled, but most of them looked sorry
for him, and his friends among the officers nodded
sympathetically as he passed them.
</p>

<p>
Silently the friends clasped hands, and George said
in low tones: 'Keep a bright look-out for me, Terence;
I shall not be long in following you.'
</p>

<p>
Colonel Cranstoun overheard the remark as he
came up with outstretched hand; but he merely
smiled and said: 'Good-bye, George.  Don't bear
malice.  I am only doing my duty, you know.'
</p>

<p>
George shook hands cordially enough with him, and
with another grip of his chum's hard fist jumped aboard
the tug, which immediately cast off.  For some time
young Haughton watched his friend, who had climbed
into the rigging and was waving frantically; but
when the frigate came up to the wind and Terence
was no longer visible, he flung himself down upon a
coil of rope and bitterly reviled his own hard lot.
</p>

<p>
Presently he rose again and gazed seawards over
the heaving Pacific.  The fine frigate, under a cloud
of canvas, was already far distant.  With longing
eyes George looked after her, and, as she skimmed
away upon the starboard tack, leaned over the taffrail
and gave himself up to gloomy meditation.
</p>

<p>
The rough-and-tumble motion of the tug suited the
turbulent thoughts which filled George's mind, but as
the little vessel passed back through the Heads and
came suddenly to an even keel, as suddenly did the
unwilling passenger realise that, while every moment
was bearing Terence nearer to the goal of their hopes,
he himself, balked and trapped, was being sent
ignominiously home like a bale of damaged goods.
</p>

<p>
He turned and began to pace the deck with quick,
decided steps.  He would not, he could not, go home.
On that point he was determined.  Right or wrong,
he had made his choice and would abide by it.
Besides, there was Terence to be thought of; Terence,
who so willingly had sacrificed a paying occupation
to follow the fortunes of his friend, and who now
was left in the lurch by this unkind trick of fate.
No; by hook or by crook he must get to New Zealand.
But how?  There was the rub.
</p>

<p>
'What ship is that?' he asked a sailor, pointing to a
smart brig anchored about half a mile from the quay,
and flying the 'Blue Peter.'
</p>

<p>
'The <i>Stella</i>, sir,' the man answered, 'and a handy
craft she is.  She sails at six o'clock to-morrow morning
for Chatham Island, with stores for the prisoners
there.'
</p>

<p>
George's heart gave a great leap, and the sailor,
greatly to his surprise, received half a crown for this
very trifling piece of information.  But it was by no
means trifling to George, whose despondency evaporated
like dew in the sunshine, as he told himself that,
come what might in the way of opposition, he would
sail in that brig and somehow reach New Zealand.
For in the Chatham Islands, some three hundred
miles east of their coast, the New Zealand Government
had established a penal settlement for Maoris,
at which ships occasionally called with provisions
and other necessaries.  And of this fortunate
circumstance George then and there made up his mind
to take the fullest advantage.
</p>

<p>
The skipper of the tug had received a sovereign
from Colonel Cranstoun as passage money for 'the
young gentleman,' and fully expected to receive
another from Colonel Haughton on delivering the
said young gentleman in good order at his own front
door.  But this money was never earned, for it cost
George but little effort to evade the clumsy seaman,
and, as soon as the tug touched the quay, he leaped
ashore and ran for his liberty.
</p>

<p>
Once out of sight he defied capture, though no
attempt was made to take him, and, having written
his father a letter, in which he described his
adventure and stated his intentions, he returned to the
quay after nightfall, hired a dingy, and pulled out to
the brig, where he had a satisfactory interview with
her skipper.
</p>

<p>
The outcome of this was an arrangement whereby
George was to help as far as he could on the voyage
to Chatham Island, to pay the cost of his food, and
to give the skipper a bonus of two pounds.  In
return he was to receive a free passage to whatever
New Zealand port the brig should first touch at
on her return voyage.  The agreement made, George
and the skipper shook hands heartily with mutual
esteem, each complimenting himself upon his shrewdness
in driving an excellent bargain.
</p>

<p>
And so George fulfilled his promise to Terence that
he would not be long in following him; though, little
as he expected it, he was destined to meet with some
strange adventures before he once again clasped
hands with his friend.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER III
<br /><br />
THE PRICE OF SUCCESS
</h3>

<p>
It was a lovely evening; lovely as evening can be in
the isle-strewn, iridescent seas beneath the Southern
Cross.  The sun, setting behind the ship which came
sailing out of the radiant west, threw his magic
mantle over the rolling clouds which lay in inky
masses where the ocean touched them in the distant
east, filling their hollows with crimson, fringing their
pinnacles and battlements with ruddy gold.  Fronting
the dreamy horizon, Wari-Kauri, Rangi-Haute,
and Rangatira[<a id="chap03fn1text"></a><a href="#chap03fn1">1</a>] slumbered peacefully in the rosy light,
while great Te Wenga's gloomy bosom caught and
kept the fire-tipped shafts.  Northwards, the
uprising cones of basalt reflected the flames in the sky.
Southwards, green-black forest and fern-grown gully
blazed for a moment ere they paled away in the
dusk.  Ahead, the surges, fearful of the night, curled
and broke with ceaseless thunder upon the reefs,
flinging high their snowy crests to snatch yet one
more glory from the day, and falling back, a shower
of jewels of ineffable hues.  Astern, as if to guide
the gliding ship, long paths of crimson light streamed
from the sinking sun, and shot aslant in wavering
lines from sky to sea, from sea to shore.  And as the
<i>Stella</i> slipped to her moorings, the rattle of the chain,
the splash of the falling anchor, broke in upon the
sweet peace; day, affrighted, fled with the sun, and
night, fearing no terrors, brooded upon sea and
land.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap03fn1"></a>
[<a href="#chap03fn1text">1</a>] The Chatham Islands, a group lying some 300 miles east of New
Zealand.  Wari-Kauri is Chatham Island proper.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
As the <i>Stella</i> neared the shore, a boat, manned by
Maori prisoners, put off to give what help might be
required.  In the stern sat a man who instantly
attracted George's attention, and, curiously enough,
the young Englishman seemed at the same moment
to become the object of profound interest on the part
of the Maori, who stared at him as if fascinated.
</p>

<p>
George had seen many Maoris and admired them;
but this one attracted him strangely, and, certainly,
no one looking at the man would have taken him
for a convict.  His face was handsome, notwithstanding
the intricate designs carved upon it from
brow to chin; his eyes bright, and so restless that
they conveyed the impression of incessantly shooting
points of light.  His figure was strong, though not
massive, and much more symmetrical than is usual
among his countrymen, who are generally short
legged and long-bodied.
</p>

<p>
Altogether he was a remarkable man, and he
moved among his companions with a stateliness and
an air of condescension which, but for his impressive
appearance, would have seemed ludicrously
incongruous.  As his furtive brown eyes, glancing this
way and that, encountered those of George, frankly
full of interest and admiration, they fell for an
instant, and then, seeing that the Englishman was
about to advance and speak to him, he clambered
hastily over the side and dropped back into the
boat.
</p>

<p>
'That is an uncommonly fine-looking fellow,'
thought George.  'I wonder what he has done to be
cooped up along with those evil-faced rascals.  Not
that his own expression is particularly engaging; but
he has not the cut of a convict.  And what a figure!
I should like to see more of him.'
</p>

<p>
It is sometimes unwise to express a wish without
previous consideration, and had George dreamed that
he was to be taken at his word, or even faintly
imagined how much more he was to see of this
splendid Maori before all was done, he would have
borrowed the wishing-cap once more, and had himself
carried back to Sydney without delay.
</p>

<p>
But George was troubled with no sinister
anticipations, and he was up and on deck betimes next
morning, for there was much to be done, and he was
not one to shirk that part of his contract which
included hard work.  The men had quickly discovered
this, and, in consequence, every one on board liked
him, while George, on his side, liked every one.  He
gave himself no airs, being sure of his own position,
but respected himself and others, and did loyally what
he had agreed to do.  As a natural result he gained
the respect and goodwill of those with whom he was
associated.
</p>

<p>
The day dawned in all the lovely colours of the
tropics, and the scene upon which George gazed was
but a more radiant rendering of the exquisite picture
of the previous evening.  Bustle already reigned
upon deck, and the captain's gig floated gently upon
the ingoing tide, ready to bear the skipper ashore.
On the island all was quiet to the eye, and apparently
the inhabitants had not yet risen, for not a soul was
to be seen.
</p>

<p>
With a cheery 'Good-morning, Mr. Haughton.  I'll
be back in an hour,' Captain Varsall set off for the
shore, and George went to work with a will, bending
his strong back over the cases in the hold and
arranging a number of iron rods for easier stowage
in the boats.
</p>

<p>
So absorbed was he in what had to be done, that
his thoughts were wholly diverted from the shore
until, half an hour or so after the departure of the
gig, he was startled to hear the sharp smack of a
rifle, fired not far away.  He left his work, and
hurried to the side of the ship, an example which was
followed by most of the crew.
</p>

<p>
A singular sight met their eyes.  A boat-load of
Maoris was being pulled with frantic haste towards
the brig, while on the island men and women, brown
and white, were running wildly and, it seemed,
aimlessly in all directions.  Shots, too, became frequent,
though neither their source nor result could be
distinguished, since they were fired somewhere behind
the houses.  Then, while the watchers wondered,
Captain Varsall was seen to run headlong out of the
Residency, turn and discharge his revolver thrice in
quick succession, and flee at top speed towards the
beach.  All at once he stopped, threw his arms above
his head, and, just as a puff of smoke curled lightly
upwards from one of the windows, fell face down
upon the sand, and lay still, with arms outstretched.
</p>

<p class="capcenter">

Captain Varsall was seen to flee at top speed towards the beach (page 28).
</p>

<p>
But there was scant time to lament the captain's
fate, for a crowd of brown men clambered over the
rail and dropped upon the deck before George could
move from the spot whence he gazed, fascinated, at
the vivid picture of life and death.  Then, even as
he turned, a deep musical voice at his side exclaimed:
'Move an inch, young Pakeha,[<a id="chap03fn2text"></a><a href="#chap03fn2">2</a>] and you shall walk
swiftly to Reinga.[<a id="chap03fn3text"></a><a href="#chap03fn3">3</a>]

</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
George possessed a good working knowledge of
the Maori tongue; but it needed no linguist to interpret
the significance of a gun, held in powerful hands
and presented at his head; nor was it less obvious
that a rising of the convicts had taken place with
complete success for the mutineers.  Resistance was
out of the question, for another lot of Maoris boarded
the brig, and ere the bewildered remnant of the crew
had fairly grasped the fact that they were attacked,
they were roughly bundled into the hold and the
hatches battened down.
</p>

<p>
George wondered why he had not been served
similarly; but he was evidently reserved for more
distinguished treatment, for his guard, motioning
towards the deck-house, said: 'Let the young Pakeha
go in there, into the little whare (house) that sits
upon the bosom of the ship.'
</p>

<p>
'<i>Ka pai!</i>' (Good!) returned George, and the fierce
brown face lightened for an instant at the sound
of the Maori speech in the mouth of the handsome
young Pakeha.
</p>

<p>
'<i>Haere ra!</i>'[<a id="chap03fn4text"></a><a href="#chap03fn4">4</a>] exclaimed the Maori, grinning and
using the native form of salutation to a departing
guest; and '<i>Au haere!</i>'[<a id="chap03fn5text"></a><a href="#chap03fn5">5</a>] answered George, feeling
pleasantly satisfied that no harm was intended him,
in the first instance at all events.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap03fn4"></a>
[<a href="#chap03fn4text">4</a>] Literally, 'Go truly.'
</p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap03fn5"></a>
[<a href="#chap03fn5text">5</a>] 'I go,' i.e. 'Good-bye.'
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
'This is a sudden change,' thought the young man,
as he looked through a little window at the shore.
'The poor skipper is done for; he has not moved
since he fell.  There's that tall fellow who was
aboard yesterday.  He is making for the beach.
Now for developments.  I suspect that he is at the
bottom of this wretched business.'
</p>

<p>
As he watched, boat-load after boat-load of Maoris
put off from the shore, their embarkation being
directed by the tall, dignified man with whom
George had been so struck the day before.  As each
boat reached the brig, it emptied itself of its
passengers and stores, and returned for more, so that
in no very long time all the quondam prisoners, to
the number of about two hundred, were transferred
to the ship.
</p>

<p>
Presently the last of the boats left the beach,
bringing the tall Maori and such of his associates
as had been employed to guard the Residency and
other houses, as well as the two sailors who had
rowed the unfortunate skipper ashore.  A short
interval followed, and then, amid the most lively
demonstrations of welcome and respect, the organiser
of the revolt boarded the brig, and stood
looking about him with the proud air of a conqueror.
</p>

<p>
With a few curt words he dismissed the fawning
crowd, and after a thorough examination of the
brig and her cargo, returned to the deck-house.  A
whisper sent the guard out of earshot, and a moment
later George found himself in the presence of the
man who was destined ere long to prove himself a
mighty warrior, and to incur the bitter hatred and
execration of every colonist in New Zealand.

CHAPTER IV
<br /><br />
TE KAREAREA[<a id="chap04fn1text"></a><a href="#chap04fn1">1</a>]
</h3>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap04fn1"></a>
[<a href="#chap04fn1text">1</a>] The Sparrow-Hawk.
</p>

<p>
As Englishman and Maori faced one another, they
afforded admirable examples of opposite types.
The one tall and superbly moulded, fair-haired and
blue-eyed, and with winning frankness and generous
high-mindedness in every line of his well-cut
features; the other not quite so tall, but equally well
made, with coal-black hair, furtive brown eyes, and
an expression indicative of courage and intelligence,
but also of a high degree of cunning.
</p>

<p>
'Salutations to you, O friend!' began the Maori in
his own language.  'How are you called?  I am Te
Karearea.  It seems you speak with the tongue of
the Maori.'
</p>

<p>
'To you also salutations, O chief!' returned George.
'I am called Hortoni.'  He gave his name according
to Maori pronunciation, adding: 'I would rather that
you spoke the speech of the Pakeha, for it is long
since I was in the land of the Maori, and I have
forgotten much.'
</p>

<p>
Te Karearea took no notice of this appeal.  'There
are some things it is wiser to forget,' he said
sententiously, with a backward glance at the shore.  'Let
us forget that I have been a&mdash;what I have been.  It
is better to remember only that I am Te Karearea,
an <i>Ariki</i>.'[<a id="chap04fn2text"></a><a href="#chap04fn2">2</a>]
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap04fn2"></a>
[<a href="#chap04fn2text">2</a>] A chief of the highest class.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
'I will remember, O swift-flying, quick-striking
one!' replied George, with a slight inclination.
</p>

<p>
This allusion to the significance of his name pleased
the chief, whose fierce features relaxed in a smile.
'It is good,' he said.  'Fear nought, Hortoni; I mean
you no evil.  No one shall suffer at my hands.'
</p>

<p>
'Yet the captain of the brig lies dead upon the
sand,' observed George, with less than his usual tact.
</p>

<p>
'He was a fool,' answered Te Karearea, with
darkening brow.  'He resisted, and my young men slew
him.'  He studied George intently for a moment,
and resumed: 'They who are wise will not walk to
Reinga.  You, for instance, Hortoni, would rather
that they should carry you there.  Is it not so, my
friend?'[<a id="chap04fn3text"></a><a href="#chap04fn3">3</a>]
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap04fn3"></a>
[<a href="#chap04fn3text">3</a>] By one familiar with Maori metaphor this would be understood to
mean that a man would prefer to await death in the natural course of
events, rather than anticipate it by resistance.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
George gravely inclined his head.
</p>

<p>
'Then hear the word of Te Karearea,' pursued the
chief.  'Can I not swallow the Pakehas on this ship
as the inrushing tide swallows the beach?  Can I
not slay or spare, according to my will?'  There
was a deep, booming note in his voice, as of distant
thunder, threatening a storm, and he paused, glaring
at George, who held his respectful attitude, not being
a fool, as Te Karearea had admitted.
</p>

<p>
'I hate the Pakehas, though there are some whom
I am able to esteem,' went on the chief, accompanying
the softening clause with a sly smile in the
direction of the listener.  'Yet, though I hate, I can
be merciful.  I can spare as well as slay.  Is it not
so, O Hortoni?'
</p>

<p>
Still George only bowed acquiescence, wondering
what the chief would be at.  He knew perfectly well
that all this circumlocution meant that the chief
wanted something of him, but what it was he could
not imagine.  So he tried the effect of a direct
question: 'What are you going to do with us?'
</p>

<p>
But the wily Maori was not to be caught.  'Time will
show, Hortoni,' he replied.  'At present I say nought.'
</p>

<p>
'To what end all this talk then, O Chief?  Are we
not as rats in a trap?  Why should the hawk converse
with the rat, if not to devour him?  Will you
then spare the lives of the rats in the hold?'
</p>

<p>
'What is all this talk of taking life?' the Maori
demanded.  'Behold, they who speak of Reinga are
on the road to Reinga.  You are young and strong.
I set you over the Pakehas.  It is the desire of Te
Karearea to set them free, and to that end let them
bring the ship to Turanga and go.  Do they wish to
be turned loose in the water?' he finished with a
sinister grin, and stalked out.
</p>

<p>
It was out at last&mdash;the end of this roundabout
parleying was in view.  Not for nothing had Te
Karearea spared the lives of the sailors.  Without
the crew the ship would have been of little use to
him; but by sparing the men he would be enabled
to reach New Zealand as speedily as the brig could
sail thither.  Otherwise, at the mercy of the winds
and waves, he might be months in completing the
voyage&mdash;if, indeed, it ever were completed.
</p>

<p>
'So that is his little game,' thought George.  'He
offers us our lives to bring him and his brother
rascals to New Zealand.  I must see the mate and
talk it over with him.  I can't decide upon my own
responsibility."
</p>

<p>
At this moment the door opened and the mate was
ushered in.
</p>

<p>
'Well now, Mr. 'Aughton, this 'ere's a rummy go,
and no mistake,' he began.  'And the poor skipper
gone, too.  I saw it all, Mr. 'Aughton, as you may say,
and&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
But George had had too much experience of the
mate's garrulity to scruple about cutting it short; so
he briefly put before the sailor the proposal of the
chief&mdash;for it amounted to a proposal&mdash;and wound
up by asking his opinion as to the best course to
pursue.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Bigham's opinion, tersely stated, was that he
hated to give in to a nigger.
</p>

<p>
'I says, let us seem to agree, but round on the
blankety niggers if we see a good chance,' he
suggested joyously.
</p>

<p>
'If we promise, we must perform, Mr. Bigham,'
said George gravely.  'Perhaps news of the rising
will reach New Zealand before we do, and a cruiser
may be sent to intercept us.'
</p>

<p>
'No chance of it.  That smart chief has seen to
that,' returned Bigham gloomily.  'The only vessel
belonging to the island was a ketch, and the beggar
sent her drifting out to sea.'  Once again he
expressed an extremely uncomplimentary opinion of
'niggers' and all their works and ways.
</p>

<p>
'Then there is nothing for it but to accept, if we
wish to save our lives.  But we must play fair,' said
George.
</p>

<p>
'I can't see as we're bound to keep our word to a
lot of darned niggers,' objected Mr. Bigham, with heat.
'If we get a chance to knock the brown brutes on the
head, why shouldn't we take it?'
</p>

<p>
George answered the fool according to his folly.
</p>

<p>
'Can't you see, Bigham, that, as we are outnumbered
by more than ten to one, we must submit?'
</p>

<p>
'But only till we get the chance to square the
account,' persisted Bigham, who hailed from Bolton,
and had all the native obstinacy of the Lancashire
man.  'Well; I'll  go and tell the men.'  And he
went.
</p>

<p>
The voice of the chief roused George from
meditations of a somewhat mixed character.  'Have you
decided, Hortoni?' he inquired, and there was a note
of triumph in his tone which convinced George that
he knew a great deal more English than he chose to
admit.
</p>

<p>
After a moment's consideration George replied for
himself.  'I give you my word that I will help to
navigate the brig to Turanga, and that I will not
attempt to embarrass you while I am on board.  On
your part, you undertake to set me free as soon as we
touch land.  That is our bargain; is it not?'
</p>

<p>
'And will Big Man promise, too?  Will the sailors
help?' asked the chief.  'Ha! here he comes.  Let us
hear what he has to say.'
</p>

<p>
'We agree,' the mate announced, but with a wink
so portentous that George was made fully aware
that the acceptance of the chief's terms covered some
deep mental reservation.  But he took no notice of
the stupid fellow's side-hint, and, turning to their
captor, said: 'It is well, O Hawk of the Mountain.
We will bring the ship to land, if you will thereafter
let us go free.'
</p>

<p>
'It is well,' echoed Te Karearea, flashing a glance
at the mate.  'You have dealt fairly with me,
Hortoni, and I am minded to be your friend.  The eyes
of the hawk are very keen, and he sees what is good
and what is bad.  So, too, I read the hearts of those
upon whom my eyes are fastened.'  Just then they
were blazing upon Bigham with a malignity which
even that dullard should have perceived.  But as he
regarded George, the chief's glance became milder.
</p>

<p>
'You have chosen wisely, O Hortoni!' he concluded.
Then with a final ambiguity, 'I shall not forget what
I have heard,' he folded his mat about his shoulders
and stalked out of the deck-house.
</p>

<p>
'You also will do well to remember what you have
heard, Mr. Bigham,' George said, translating Te
Karearea's speech for him.  'I hope you were sincere
in what you said just now,' he continued with some
severity.  'We have to deal with a very clever man,
and I earnestly advise you not to measure your wits
against his.'
</p>

<p>
Bigham's grin widened, and he winked more
portentously than before.  Otherwise he made no reply.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap05"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER V
<br /><br />
THE GRATITUDE OF TE KAIHUIA
</h3>

<p>
For the first few days the voyage was uneventful,
and the Maoris, revelling in the freedom which the
courage and skill of their leader had won for them,
behaved like a parcel of children unexpectedly let
loose from school.  Te Karearea himself devoted a
good deal of time to the conciliation of the young
Englishman, with whom he would often engage in
conversation with a charm of manner which was
hard to resist.  Invariably, too, he bewailed his
inability to converse in the Pakeha tongue, though
he admitted that he had mastered a few words
which served him well enough upon unimportant
occasions.
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, one night when Bigham&mdash;who was
for ever whispering among the men after
dark&mdash;dismissed three of his cronies after a muttered
colloquy, the dark form of the chief rose from the
lifeboat, beneath which the meeting had taken place.
He looked cautiously about him, and then, seeing no
one but his own guards, who patrolled the deck
night and day, leaped lightly down and stole away.
</p>

<p>
But George had observed him, and deliberated
whether he should warn Bigham.  Finally, however,
he decided to wait, feeling confident that the mate
would not take any important step without consulting
him, in which case he would be in a better
position to protest against any foolhardy venture.
</p>

<p>
The days wore on, the light winds growing lighter
and lighter, until at length there fell a dead calm; the
<i>Stella</i> floated idly upon the vast bosom of the sea,
and the lively chatter of the Maoris gave way to
gloomy silence, while their scarred faces scowled,
and their fierce brown eyes flashed wrath at the
white sailors, as if they alone were responsible for
the vagaries of the weather.
</p>

<p>
One afternoon&mdash;it was the third day of the calm&mdash;as
George swung drowsily in his hammock, he was
aroused by a shrill scream and the patter of feet
along the deck.  Again the scream rang out, high
and quavering, and presently was drowned by a deep-toned
chant, chorussed by a hundred rich male voices
which rose and fell in unison.
</p>

<p>
'They are propitiating the wind-god, I suppose,'
mused George, feeling too lazy to get up and find out.
'Yesterday they threw their greenstone ornaments
overboard; but it did no good.  What children
they are for all their strength and&mdash;Hullo!  Good
heavens!'
</p>

<p>
He sat suddenly upright, with the result that he
pitched out of his hammock with a nasty bump; but
he was up in a second, and as he raced up the
forehatch, the words of the chant came clearly to his
horrified ears:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  '... Come, then, Te Kaihuia, old friend!<br />
  Come, O thou ancient and venerable Palm Tree!<br />
  Come, beloved uncle, and be sacrificed straightway!<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deep sea waits for thee;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For us wait the gentle, favouring winds<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To bear us home.  So come....'<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The Maoris were grouped in a double crescent, the
horns touching the starboard gangway, beside which
stood Te Karearea, wearing the complacent expression
of a man who generously sacrifices a most
cherished possession for the good of the public.
Opposite to him two big Maoris bent over a very
old and withered creature, whom, with many
expressions of endearment, they were encouraging to
take a header into the sea.
</p>

<p>
The old man&mdash;the 'ancient Palm Tree' of the
chant&mdash;was Te Kaihuia, an uncle of Te Karearea, and
since the sacrifice of the greenstone ornaments had
not availed to propitiate the god of winds and
storms, the chief had graciously given permission for
his aged relative to be thrown into the sea.  Meanwhile
the singers, at the top of their lusty voices,
asserted the cheerful acquiescence of the victim.
</p>

<p>
But the poor old man was not willing, and his
heartrending appeal for mercy so moved George
that he roughly pushed his way through a group of
grinning seamen, sharply chiding them for their
cruel indifference, and walked straight up to the
chief.
</p>

<p>
'What is this, O Te Karearea?' he demanded
haughtily.  'Why do you allow your young men to
maltreat old Te Kaihuia?  Whatever your followers
may believe, you know well enough that to murder
an old man for the sake of getting a breeze is a
piece of stupid cruelty.'
</p>

<p>
In his excitement he had spoken in English; but
the amused gleam in the chief's eyes assured him
that he had been understood, so without a pause he
went on in Maori: 'Let him live, my friend, and I
promise you the wind before evening.'
</p>

<p>
Te Karearea started and stared hard at George,
who had, of course, spoken impulsively, and looked
rather foolish when pressed for an explanation;
whereupon the chief's lips curled in a cynical smile,
and he made a covert sign to the men who were
holding his ancient relative.
</p>

<p>
Alert to catch the signal, they swung up the old
fellow and, before George could turn, flung him far
out into the sea, where, with that curious instinct
which seems to attract them whenever death is in
the air, several sharks were already gathered, their
triangular dorsal fins moving ceaselessly to and fro
as they waited, expectant, for their prey.
</p>

<p>
But, even as the old man vanished over the side,
George burst through the crescent and took a running
jump into the sea.  So swift was his action that
the noise of the two bodies striking the water came
to the ears of those on board as one great splash,
and as the crew of the brig, now thoroughly ashamed
of themselves, cheered enthusiastically, George
appeared above the surface, holding the old Maori
in the loop of one arm, while with the other he
struck out vigorously.
</p>

<p>
Quick as thought, Te Karearea seized a rifle from
the nearest armed guard and fired at a black fin
which drove swiftly in the wake of the swimmer.
The ball went home, and in an instant the sea was
dyed red, as the rapacious sharks tore in pieces the
body of their late ally.
</p>

<p>
But for this timely intervention a frightful tragedy
must have been enacted; but, as it was, while the
guards at a word from their chief directed a terrific
fusillade at the sharks, Bigham cast a rope to
George, who was hauled up not much the worse
for his dive, while the air rang with the hurrahs
of the crew.
</p>

<p>
The ancient gentleman was handed over the side
in a very limp condition, and borne away to be dried
and ironed, as it were, while George, with an ugly
scowl at Te Karearea, who came up all smiles and
compliments, hurried below to change his clothes.
</p>

<p>
Singularly enough, shortly after this exciting
episode the smiling azure of the sea began to
darken, and as the shadow crept nearer, and
Neptune's white horses left their stables in the deep
and galloped upon the crests of the waves, a light
breeze began to tickle the cheeks of the sails and
to hum among the cordage; so that presently the
bo'sun's cheerful pipe shrilled along the deck, and
the sailors, bounding aloft or hauling upon the
sheets, soon made all snug for the run.
</p>

<p>
The amazement of the Maoris, who had overheard
and jeered at George's promise to their chief, may
be imagined, and the venturesome prophet's
reputation was then and there established among them.
Whatever he thought of the matter, Te Karearea
kept his opinion to himself, and, waving aside those
who would have babbled of it, wrapped himself in
his mat and paced the deck in grave meditation.
</p>

<p>
When George had changed into a blue pilot-cloth
suit, which had belonged to Captain Varsall, he
hurried on deck to look for old Te Kaihuia, whom
he found reclining upon a mat in a sunny corner.
</p>

<p>
'A narrow escape, O venerable friend!' began the
young man, smiling down upon the shrivelled figure.
'You have looked through the gates of Reinga.'
</p>

<p>
The old Maori smiled back into the frank,
good-tempered face, and motioning George to a mat beside
him, intimated his desire to perform the <i>hongi</i>, or
pressing together of noses, to which George
submitted with a good grace and, when the ceremony
was over, prepared to withdraw.  But the old man
begged him to remain, as he had something further
to say.
</p>

<p>
With the greatest gravity Te Kaihuia drew a
parcel from beneath his mat, and with trembling
fingers unrolled the half-dozen layers of native cloth
which formed the wrapping.  Then with an air of
reverence almost amounting to awe, he drew out a
greenstone <i>mere</i>,[<a id="chap05fn1text"></a><a href="#chap05fn1">1</a>] or club, of most perfect shape and
colour, which he held up to the admiring gaze of the
Englishman.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap05fn1"></a>
[<a href="#chap05fn1text">1</a>] Pronounced almost as the English word 'merry.'
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
'What a beautiful&mdash;what a magnificent piece of
greenstone!' exclaimed George in genuine delight.
Then, as Te Kaihuia regarded the weapon with a
look of mingled veneration and affection: 'Is it an
heirloom&mdash;the <i>mere</i> of your ancestors?'
</p>

<p>
'You are right, Hortoni,' replied the veteran.  'Far
back in the misty past, approaching the time when
the Maori first set foot in Te Ika A Maui,[<a id="chap05fn2text"></a><a href="#chap05fn2">2</a>] this <i>mere</i>
belonged, according to tradition, to my ancestor,
Te Turi.[<a id="chap05fn3text"></a><a href="#chap05fn3">3</a>]  After him, it was handed down from
father to son through many generations.'
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap05fn2"></a>
[<a href="#chap05fn2text">2</a>] The north island of New Zealand.  Literally, 'The Fish of Maui.'
</p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap05fn3"></a>
[<a href="#chap05fn3text">3</a>] Maori names were frequently bestowed on account of physical or
mental peculiarities, or of real or fancied resemblance to natural
objects.  Te Turi means The Obstinate, or Stubborn, One.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
'Then your ancestor, Te Turi, was one of the earliest
settlers in New Zealand?'
</p>

<p>
'He was, Hortoni, having come with Ngahue from
Hawaiki.'[<a id="chap05fn4text"></a><a href="#chap05fn4">4</a>]
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap05fn4"></a>
[<a href="#chap05fn4text">4</a>] According to tradition, Ngahue was the Maori discoverer of New
Zealand, arriving from a mythical island, Hawaiki.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
George took up the club and examined it.  He had
seen many a piece of greenstone before, both in the
rough and fashioned into ornaments and weapons;
but never had he seen anything so beautiful as this
<i>mere</i>.  Its shape was perfect, and not only was the
rich green mineral nearly as transparent as glass,
but all through its substance ran the most exquisite
veining and traceries, resembling fern-fronds, flowers,
miniature trees, and even birds and fishes.  'It is a
most beautiful object,' he said, handing it back.
'Your ancestor must have had wonderful pride in
his workmanship.'
</p>

<p>
Te Kaihuia cast an apprehensive glance around;
then whispered almost inaudibly: 'The <i>mere</i> was
bestowed upon Te Turi.  He did not make it.'
</p>

<p>
'Well, who gave it to him?' inquired George,
amused at the goblin-like aspect of the old creature.
</p>

<p>
With another timid look above and around, Te
Kaihuia whispered again with thrilling emphasis:
'It was made by Tumatauenga, the god of war, and
he bestowed it upon Te Turi.'
</p>

<p>
'Ah! then I am not surprised you set such store by
it,' said George, careful to suppress the smile which
would have hurt the old man's feelings.  'Such a
beautiful piece of work deserves to have a romantic
history.'
</p>

<p>
But he was destined to be surprised after all, for
the aged Maori, balancing the club in his worn hands,
said impressively: 'You, too, must set great store by
it, Hortoni, for it is the gift of a god, and has
marvellous powers.  O brave young friend, who thought
the remnant of an old man's life worth the risk
of your own, stretch forth your hand and receive
this gift from me.  Treasure it, my son, for it is
yours.'
</p>

<p>
'<i>Mine!</i>' echoed George, supremely astonished.
'<i>Mine!</i>  Oh no, Te Kaihuia, this must not be.  I
will not take so valuable an heirloom from you.'
</p>

<p>
'It is mine to give,' persisted the hoary chief.
'Descendants I have none.  There is but my sister's son,
Te Karearea, and rather than that he should inherit
it, I would fling it into the sea.  And this I swear I
will do, Hortoni, if you take not the <i>mere</i> as a gift.'  He
gently pressed the club upon George, who took it
with the greatest reluctance.
</p>

<p>
'Hearken, Hortoni,' the old man went on.  'There
is much virtue in this <i>mere</i>, and some day, perhaps
ere long, you shall rejoice that it is yours.  Take it,
my son, and with it an old man's blessing for that
your stout heart and strong arm succoured him in his
extremity.'
</p>

<p>
The superstitious veneration in which the Maoris
held the greenstone, and their devotion to family
relics, were well known to George; but when he
realised that the old chief was sincere in his
intention to destroy the heirloom rather than allow it to
pass into other hands than his own, he made suitable
acknowledgments, and thrust the beautiful weapon
into that division of his belt which had once
contained his revolver.
</p>

<p>
His point gained, old Te Kaihuia seemed highly
delighted, and rubbed his lean hands together, grinning
and chattering to himself.  Finally he calmed down,
and with a sly glance at George, said coaxingly: 'If
you are not tired of an old man's tale, Hortoni,
perhaps you would like to hear the history of the
<i>mere</i> which has now become your own.'
</p>

<p>
'I should, indeed,' answered George, who had been
wondering whether he might ask this very favour
without giving offence or intruding upon family
secrets.
</p>

<p>
Te Kaihuia looked pleased, settled himself upon
his mats, coughed once or twice after the manner
of an orator about to address an audience, and then,
after a false start or two, unfolded to the interested
listener the following singular history.

<h3>
CHAPTER VI
<br /><br />
THE STORY OF THE GREENSTONE MERE
</h3>

<p>
Te Turi, my ancestor, one day called to him his two
friends, Te Weri, the Centipede, and Te Waerau, the
Crab, whom he loved best after Ngahue, and taking
a sailing canoe, with three men to row upon windless
days, set out from Te Ika A Maui on a course to
the south.
</p>

<p>
And when they had sailed for many days, they
came to the mouth of a river, and there they ate
food and landed.
</p>

<p>
And as they stepped ashore, Te Turi chanted a
prayer of propitiation to the Spirit of the Land, and
they six prayed together and humiliated themselves.
And afterwards, looking about them, they saw that
the land was very fair; for the <i>pohutukaua</i> trees[<a id="chap06fn1text"></a><a href="#chap06fn1">1</a>] and
the <i>ratas</i>[<a id="chap06fn1btext"></a><a href="#chap06fn1">1</a>] were ablaze with red blossoms, and the
white flowers of the <i>puawananga</i>[<a id="chap06fn2text"></a><a href="#chap06fn2">2</a>] were shining like
stars in the deep green of lofty boughs.  And the
blue sky smiled down upon them, and the warm sun
of morning stirred their blood, and the sweet scents
of the forest beguiled their senses, so that with one
accord they cried aloud, 'Behold!  The new land
which the gods have given us is very good.'
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap06fn1"></a>
[<a href="#chap06fn1text">1</a>] The pohutukaua and rata trees belong to the myrtle order.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap06fn2"></a>
[<a href="#chap06fn2text">2</a>] The puawananga is a variety of clematis with large, star-like
white blossoms.  In the flowering season the effect of these white stars
amid the dark metallic green of the overhead foliage is most beautiful.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
But of a sudden the forest grew denser, till at last
they saw neither sun nor moon, nor could they find
food to eat or water to drink&mdash;not even fern-roots
or <i>kanini</i> berries, which might have stayed the
terrible pangs of hunger.
</p>

<p>
So then the five began to blame Te Turi that he
had brought them out of a land of plenty into this
wilderness, and Te Turi, being sorry for them, bade
them rest while he went on to seek deliverance.
</p>

<p>
So Te Turi walked alone, and, as he walked, it grew
so cold that he drew his mat of <i>kiwi</i>[<a id="chap06fn3text"></a><a href="#chap06fn3">3</a>] feathers close
about him.  Yet still was he cold as death, and at
last, crying to the gods to show him a way whereby
his friends and the three men might be saved, he fell
prone upon the ground.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap06fn3"></a>
[<a href="#chap06fn3text">3</a>] The <i>apteryx</i>, a curious, small, wingless bird.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Now the blackness of night was around him,
though it was yet full day; but, though he feared the
darkness, he feared more for his companions lest
they should die of cold and hunger and thirst.  'For
then,' said he, 'the blame shall be mine, for I it was
who brought them to this pass.'  Wherefore he
prayed for his friends more than for himself.
</p>

<p>
But presently he rose and made a fire of sticks to
warm his blood.  But, though the fire burned, neither
did it warm him nor give any light beyond itself.
Wherefore Te Turi was sure that the gods were
angry, and he prayed that he might propitiate them
by the sacrifice of the best thing he had, though he
himself should die for want of it.
</p>

<p>
So he laid his beautiful mat of feathers upon
the fire, which greedily devoured it, and then he
scattered the ashes to the four quarters of the earth
and chanted a prayer to ATUA.[<a id="chap06fn4text"></a><a href="#chap06fn4">4</a>]
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap06fn4"></a>
[<a href="#chap06fn4text">4</a>] The gods collectively, or Fate.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Then lo, a marvel!  For of a sudden Te Turi grew
warm and the dark forest fell away, and before him
opened a glade, rich in flowers and fruit, and in the
midst of it a stream of water, crystal pure.
</p>

<p>
Then, filled with joy, Te Turi stretched out his
hand, for he was very hungry.  Yet even in that
moment he remembered his friends and the men,
and, having first gathered fruit and filled a gourd
with water for them, he ate and drank his fill.
</p>

<p>
And now, being strengthened in spirit and in body,
Te Turi bowed his head and gave thanks to ATUA
and prayed to his ancestors.
</p>

<p>
And, as he lifted his head, lo, before him was a mat
of kiwi feathers, larger and more beautiful than he
had ever seen, and very soft and perfect, as a mat
sent from the gods ought to be.  For Te Turi knew
that the gods had sent him the mat because he had
thought of his friends before himself.  So,
marvelling, he put it on and turned to rejoin his
companions.
</p>

<p>
But a voice cried 'Stay!' and Te Turi, seeing no
one, feared, and turned again.
</p>

<p>
And the voice was dull and muffled, as though it
came from the bowels of the earth, and it said: 'O
Te Turi, I am HAUMIATIKITIKI, god and father of
men and of the foods which men gather and eat.
For all thy life abundance of such food shall be
thine.  Behold, I have spoken!'
</p>

<p>
Then Te Turi gave thanks and turned to go.  But
another voice cried 'Stay!' and he remained.
</p>

<p>
And the voice came from the surface of the ground
and from the tree-tops, and it said: 'O Te Turi, I am
RONGOMATANE, god and father of men and of the
foods which men prepare for themselves.  For all
thy life abundance of such food shall be thine.
Behold, I have spoken!'
</p>

<p>
And again Te Turi gave thanks and turned to go.  But
a third voice cried 'Stay!' and, marvelling, he stayed.
</p>

<p>
And the voice was like to the murmur of waving
boughs, the humming of bees, and the sweet singing
of birds, and it said: 'O Te Turi, I am TANE MAHUTA,
god of the forests and the birds.  The trees shall be
thine for thy dwellings, and the hardest trees for
canoes and spears and clubs; and the birds shall be
thine for food and dress as long as thou livest.
Behold, I have spoken!'
</p>

<p>
And once more Te Turi gave thanks and turned to
go.  But a fourth voice cried 'Stay!' and with wonder
in his heart he stood still.
</p>

<p>
And the voice was like the leaping of fish and the
croaking of frogs, and it said: 'O Te Turi, I am
TANGAROA, god of fish and reptiles.  All through
thy life thou shalt have fish to eat and sharks' teeth
for ornament, and whalebone and whales' ribs for
thy weapons.  And the little lizards shall not affright
thee, nor the great <i>Taniwha</i>[<a id="chap06fn5text"></a><a href="#chap06fn5">5</a>] harm thee.  Behold, I
have spoken!'
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap06fn5"></a>
[<a href="#chap06fn5text">5</a>] A mythical monster, presumed to be a saurian, inhabiting the
sea or vast forests, and regarded with deepest awe by Maoris.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
And again Te Turi gave thanks and essayed to go.
But a fifth voice cried 'Stay!' and, filled with awe, he
halted where he was.
</p>

<p>
And the voice was like the roaring of a mighty
wind, and the sound of trees falling in the bush, of
rain and hail beating upon the hard ground, and
thunder rolling among the caverns of the clouds
upon the mountains.  And it said: 'O Te Turi, I
am TAWHIRI-MA-TEA, god of the winds and storms,
and whether thou walkest upon dry land or sailest
upon the bosom of the deep waters, harm shall be
far from thee.  Behold, I have spoken!'
</p>

<p>
Then Te Turi gave thanks and turned to go.  But
a sixth voice shouted 'Stay!' and he stayed, his heart
melting within him for fear.
</p>

<p>
For of a sudden there arose a mighty noise, and
such a clashing and clanging and screaming and
shouting and shaking of the earth, as though all
the warriors of all the world ran to and fro over it,
contending in battle.  And then, also of a sudden,
there fell a great silence, and Te Turi waited with
bowed head for the sixth god to speak.
</p>

<p>
But, when at last he heard no voice, he lifted his
eyes, and lo, a rat which sat upon a bough and
fished in the river with a line.  Whereat Te Turi
was amazed, fearing magic.  But, when the rat drew
in the line, behold, not a fish, but a piece of
greenstone of the best and purest was on the end of it.
And the rat swung the line so that the stone came
near to Te Turi, who put forth his hand and caught it.
</p>

<p>
And then the sixth voice spake and said: 'Hold
fast that which thou hast gotten, O Te Turi, for
never weapon like it was given to mortal.  I am
TUMATAUENGA, god and father of men and war.  In
the fight I will guard thee, and in battle thou shalt
prevail so long as the <i>Mere of TUMATAUJENGA</i> remains
thine.  And so shall it be with thy seed after thee,
until the <i>mere</i> shall pass to one of a strange race, and
then there shall be an end.  Behold, I have spoken!'
</p>

<p>
And Te Turi looked, and lo, in his hand was a most
perfect <i>mere</i> of greenstone, with flaxen wrist-loop,
and on the narrow end the print of two fingers and
a thumb, where TUMATAUENGA had held it.  Whereat
Te Turi marvelled exceedingly, thinking not of the
prophecy which went with the gift, and, bowing his
head, he gave thanks to the six great brethren.
</p>

<p>
And now once more he turned to go; but, even as
he turned, lo, a Thing, a great and horrible Thing,
stood in his way.
</p>

<p>
The Thing was as a bird, but bigger than any bird
of the forest, for it stood thrice the height of a man.
Its neck was the length of a tall man, its legs the
thickness of a man's trunk, and on its feet were
claws the length of a whale's rib and sharp as the
teeth of a shark.  Its wings were little, but its beak
was as long as two spears, and the gape of its mouth
was as wide as the cavern through which men pass
to enter Te Reinga.[<a id="chap06fn6text"></a><a href="#chap06fn6">6</a>]
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap06fn6"></a>
[<a href="#chap06fn6text">6</a>] Probably Te Turi encountered a Moa (Dinornis Moa), the gigantic
wingless bird, believed now to be extinct in New Zealand.  His
imagination, excited by danger, doubtless added to its already enormous
proportions.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Now Te Turi was a very brave, strong man, but
his legs shook under him as he saw this ugly, fearful
Thing.  And the Thing, noting his fear, gaped and
rushed to swallow him, and out of its mouth came a
vast roaring, as of the sea breaking upon a pebbly
shore.
</p>

<p>
Then Te Turi dropped his greenstone club and fled
for his life, crying aloud to TANE MAHUTA: 'Where
is now the dominion thou gavest me over the birds?
If indeed this monster be a bird, and not a <i>taipo</i>
(devil), which much I doubt.'
</p>

<p>
But it seemed as if the gods were angry with Te
Turi; for, when he would have hidden in the forest,
lo, in a moment there grew up a tall hedge of thorns
and supple-jacks, through which neither man nor
beast could pierce.  So then Te Turi gave himself up
for lost.
</p>

<p>
And, as he sped round and round the glade, the
roaring of the evil Thing shaped to a voice which
cried after him: 'Malign now thy gods, Te Turi, and
I will cease from pursuing thee, and will make thee
great; but if thou worship not me thou shalt perish.'
</p>

<p>
Then Te Turi knew that the Thing was indeed a
<i>taipo</i>; but he would not revile the gods, but only
called more loudly upon ATUA for aid.
</p>

<p>
And, as he called, his foot caught in a root and he
fell headlong, and the spear-bill of the Thing sped at
him, coming so near that it grazed his skin, and the
blood flowed.  And the point of the bill drave into
the ground for the half of its length, and there
stuck fast.
</p>

<p>
Now when Te Turi saw this, he flung himself upon
the long neck of the Thing and strove to snap the
bone, but his hands were not large enough to encircle
it, and meanwhile the Thing had freed half of the
buried part of its bill, and the earth flew this way
and that, as it scratched and tore and twisted, striving
to loosen itself and finish Te Turi.
</p>

<p>
Then Te Turi went blind with rage, forgetting his
danger, and, just as the Thing won free, he rushed
upon it once more and smote it so mighty a blow
that its head was crushed like the shell of an egg,
and the Thing fell to the ground with a dreadful
crash, and sprawled there in the agonies of death.
</p>

<p>
Then did Te Turi swell out his chest and roll up
his eyes and poke out his tongue at the Thing, and
because he was very glad, he chanted: 'Behold, I
have slain the evil Thing which sought to devour me.
Ha!  With one blow of my naked fist I have slain it,
for the gods have made me very strong.'  And he
looked at the fist which had done this wonderful
deed.
</p>

<p>
But lo, a marvel!  For the greenstone club, which
had dropped from his hand, was now firmly clasped
therein, and with the <i>mere</i> of TUMATAUENGA, and
not with his naked fist, had he slain the Thing.
</p>

<p>
Now when Te Turi knew that TUMATAUENGA,
seeing his extremity, had brought the <i>mere</i> to his
hand, he left off boasting, and chanted: 'Lo now the
kindness of ATUA!  Behold the goodness of
TUMATAUENGA!  When I forget the debt I owe to
TUMATAUENGA, then may ATUA forget me!'
</p>

<p>
So he gave thanks for his great deliverance, and
took the skin and the tail-feathers of the dead Thing
to make mats for a memory of the marvel, and with
a glad heart set off to rejoin his friends and the three
men.
</p>

<p>
Yet, even as he thought of them, lo, he heard their
voices, and was back at the spot where he had left
them.  And they ate and drank and were merry,
knowing nought, for they had neither seen nor
heard anything, so that Te Turi might have thought
that he had fallen asleep and dreamed, but for the
mat of <i>kiwi</i> feathers and the greenstone club and the
parts of the great Thing.
</p>

<p>
And so they six returned to Te Ika A Maui, taking
with them many pieces of greenstone and other
good things, and so they came home.  And Te Turi
made mats out of the skin of the Thing; and one he
gave to Ngahue, and one to Te Weri, and one to Te
Waerau, and one to his wife, and one he made for
himself.  Yet was there enough left to make mats
for all his children who came afterwards, of whom
there were ten.
</p>

<p>
But the greenstone <i>mere</i> with the finger-prints of
TUMATAUENGA Te Turi kept for himself, and as
often as he looked at it, so often did he wonder at
the prophecy which the god had spoken with the
gift.  But at last, remembering that the <i>mere</i> was
to pass to his children's children, he ceased from
troubling upon a matter which he could not mend.
</p>

<p>
And Te Turi lived long and fought many good
fights, being worsted in none.  And in the fulness of
time this mighty chief passed to join his ancestors,
and the <i>mere</i> of TUMATAUENGA and the prophecy he
bequeathed to his son and to his son's son after him
through all time, until at last they came down to me
who tell the tale of them.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VII
<br /><br />
STORM SIGNALS
</h3>

<p>
Valuable as he knew the greenstone <i>mere</i> to be,
both intrinsically and on account of its romantic
history, it was with a new and deeper interest that
George regarded it at the conclusion of Te Kaihuia's
legend of its origin.  Of course the story of its
supernatural appearance and manufacture was a fairy-tale
which&mdash;he gave an unmistakable start, and a grim
smile curled the thin lips of the old Maori, who was
watching him intently.
</p>

<p>
There, on the narrow end, or handle, of the club
were three deeply set impressions, which exactly
resembled the imprint of two fingers and a
thumb.
</p>

<p>
The mineral nephrite, or greenstone, is singularly
hard and unyielding, and how these peculiar marks
came to be made upon the club George concluded
to leave to the antiquaries to solve; for, needless to
say, the old chief's version of their cause counted for
nothing with him.  But he was far too courteous to
allow his incredulity to appear before the venerable
narrator, whom he warmly thanked as he rose to
take his leave.
</p>

<p>
Te Kaihuia took the young fellow's strong hand in
both his own.
</p>

<p>
'I have yet a word for you, Hortoni,' he said
gravely.  'Never allow the <i>mere</i> to be far from your
hand.  Danger lurks we know not where.  Hear now
my word.'
</p>

<p>
Wondering whether the old man's mysteriously
given advice held a covert warning of impending
trouble, George went below and locked the greenstone
club in a sea-chest which the dead captain
had lent him.  Moreover, he determined to wear the
weapon during his night-watches on deck, in case of
treachery such as his aged friend had seemed vaguely
to hint at.
</p>

<p>
Trouble, indeed, was nearer than he thought; but
it was not to come&mdash;in the first instance, at all
events&mdash;from Te Karearea and his Maoris.
</p>

<p>
Late that night as George swung in his hammock,
he was awakened by something jolting against his
body, and, peering drowsily over the edge, saw a line
of dark figures stealing cautiously up the ladder.  In
a flash he leaped lightly to the floor and collared the
hindmost of the procession.
</p>

<p>
'You, Bigham!' he exclaimed as the fo'c'sle lamp
illumined the face of his captive.  'How comes the
leader of the mutiny to bring up the rear?'
</p>

<p>
Bigham gave himself away at once.  'We knew
you wouldn't approve,' he whispered, 'so we thought
we'd surprise you when the thing was done.'
</p>

<p>
George flew into one of his rare rages.  'You ass!
It will be a mercy if one of us is left alive when the
thing is done.  Call back the men.  Quick!  There is
no time to lose.'
</p>

<p>
But Bigham's Lancashire obstinacy resented this
interference, and with a sudden twist he darted on
deck, saying huskily, 'Let them laugh as win.'
</p>

<p>
Slipping on his trousers, George made all haste after
him, but the night was so dark that he could not
make out the stations of the conspirators.  Neither
could he hear the soft pad, pad of the bare-footed
sentries.
</p>

<p>
'Curious if the guards have been withdrawn on
this night of all others,' he mused.  'If I don't
encounter our men in another minute, I'll  shout and
rouse the ship.  Better Bigham's wrath than the
slaughter which is sure to follow this senseless
provocation of a friendly foe.'
</p>

<p>
Fearful of delay and its bitter consequences, he
drew in his breath for a shout, when, sudden as a
lightning flash, a column of fire shot into the air,
illumining the black recesses of the brig.  And, as it
flared, the quiet night was shaken by an appalling
yell, shouts and oaths, the tramp and shuffle of naked
feet, the sound of shots and heavy blows, all horribly
mixed with screams of rage and hate.
</p>

<p>
'It is all up!' muttered George, filled with resentment
against the stupid mate.  'The rising is none of
my doing; but parole or no parole, I can't stand by
and see white men done to death by Maori criminals.'  He
raised his voice to a shout.  'Bigham!  Call to me!'
</p>

<p>
No answer!  Then out of the gloom a tall figure
leaped at him with uplifted arm and smote strongly
downwards.
</p>

<p>
George had neither heard nor seen the Maori's
approach, though he actually turned at that moment
as if to face the threatening danger.  The first thing
of which he was really conscious was the sound of a
blow and the jarring shock which ran from his
fingers to his shoulder.  Then to his amazement a
stalwart Maori fell with a thud and lay dead or badly
wounded at his feet.
</p>

<p>
Experience has shown that, during the excitement
bred of extreme peril, one may perform many actions
by instinct, or, at least, that one's conscious
intelligence does not appear to be fully at work.  And now so
stupefied was George at the sequence of events, that
he stood staring down at the body of the Maori
without the slightest comprehension of what had
happened.
</p>

<p>
The light of the fire flared towards him, illumining
the thing he held in his hand.  It was a greenstone
club&mdash;his own; for he could distinctly see the odd
markings upon it.
</p>

<p>
How was this? he asked himself.  Was it possible
that Te Kaihuia's story&mdash;Oh, nonsense! ... Still,
how came the <i>mere</i> to his hand?  He had locked it
away in his sea-chest....  He had never thought of
it when he rushed on deck at the heels of Bigham....
What could it mean?
</p>

<p>
Thoughts are lightning quick, and but little time
passed, as George stood fixed and immovable beside
the prostrate Maori, before another tall form loomed
suddenly out of the dark, and a familiar voice said
in Maori: 'Salutations, O friend!  The fight is begun.
Let the wise look on while the fools strive with one
another.'
</p>

<p>
'Come and help me stop the conflict,' began George,
when Te Karearea, catching sight of the still form,
interrupted sternly: 'What is this, Hortoni?  Had I
not your promise?  Wherefore have you slain my
young man?'
</p>

<p>
'I&mdash;I hope he is not dead,' stammered George.  'I
suppose I struck him, but&mdash;oh, I dare say you won't
believe me, Chief; but I knew nothing of this foolish
affair until a few minutes ago, and I did my best to
stop it.'
</p>

<p>
Te Karearea drew a lantern from the folds of his
mat, held it up, and looked keenly into George's
eyes.  Then all at once his haughty glare gave place to
a look of abject terror.  'W-w-what is that in your
hand, Hortoni?' he asked, in a voice vibrating with
intense feeling.
</p>

<p>
'The club?  It is a present which Te Kaihuia gave
me after I pulled him out of the water.  He&mdash;why,
what's the matter?'
</p>

<p>
For Te Karearea, in what appeared to be mortal
affright, reeled backwards to the bulwarks, and only
saved himself from a heavy fall by clinging to the
rail.  'The <i>mere</i>!  The <i>mere</i> of TUMATAUENGA!' he
shrieked, in a voice so shrill that it rose above the
lessening din of conflict.
</p>

<p>
George was growing confused amid the maze
of events through which he was threading his way,
but the incongruity of the position struck him even
then.  Only a few yards distant strife was raging,
bullets actually sang over their heads, and yet there
they stood, discussing other matters, as if nothing
out of the common were happening.  There was,
however, an explanation of Te Karearea's unconcern
with the fight, which George did not receive till later.
</p>

<p>
All that had occurred since he came on deck
occupied far less time than has been required to
write of it; nevertheless, he was growing anxious
about the fate of Bigham and the crew.  So, pointing
aft, where the struggle waned to a close, he said:
'While we talk here, O Chief, blood is flowing over
there.  It is time to stop the mischief.'
</p>

<p>
'The blood of the Pakehas is upon their own heads,
Hortoni,' retorted Te Karearea, who had recovered
his equanimity, and now slowly sauntered after
George towards the scene of the fray.
</p>

<p>
As they came up, Bigham, who was unhurt, greeted
George with words of scorn.  'There you are,
Mr. Haughton, with your brown friend, safe enough, I
dare say.  I hope you like your position.  Had you
joined us, things might have been different.'
</p>

<p>
'They would, indeed!'  A voice close to George
just breathed the words.
</p>

<p>
'Did you speak, Chief?' he asked sharply.
</p>

<p>
'Nay; I said nought, Hortoni,' was the smooth
answer.
</p>

<p>
'Of course he would deny it,' thought George.
'What was his meaning, I wonder.'  He turned to
Bigham.  'I gave you fair warning that I would take
no part in your wild schemes.  However, we can
discuss later your grievance against me.  How many
of your men are hurt?'
</p>

<p>
Another surprise, but this time an agreeable one.
It was Te Karearea who replied: 'None, Hortoni.
I had knowledge of Big Man's plot&mdash;it matters not
how.'  George thought that he knew.  'I gave orders,
therefore, that at a certain moment every Pakeha
on deck should be secured&mdash;save only yourself,' with
a courteous bow.  'So Big Man and those with him
walked into my trap which I had set, and my young
men have done as I bade them&mdash;all save the stupid
Paeroa, who blundered up against you, and&mdash;and&mdash;the
<i>mere</i> of TUMATAUENGA smote him.'
</p>

<p>
There was a tremulous note in his voice, and he
glanced furtively over his shoulder, while his lips
moved as he muttered something beneath his breath.
</p>

<p>
At their chief's last words the Maoris huddled
together in awed surprise, and some of them followed
his example and murmured a karakia, or charm, to
keep off invisible powers.
</p>

<p>
Again George was puzzled.  What was the matter
with every one to-night?  At the same time he was
greatly relieved; but, not wishing to show his
satisfaction too plainly, rallied the chief upon his
manifest trepidation.
</p>

<p>
'Since there are no dead men, why do you mutter
a <i>karakia</i>, O Hawk of the Mountain?' he said.  'Are
you afraid that <i>Taniwha</i> will come out of the sea
and&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
He broke off in amazement, for Te Karearea's
teeth were chattering and his eyes rolling wildly.
Evidently he was under the dominion of some fearful
emotion.  Thrice he essayed to speak and thrice
failed, while the Maoris, comprehending nothing
but the one awesome word, and perceiving, as they
thought, its effect upon their leader, shrank away,
quaking with dread and muttering, '<i>Taniwha!
Taniwha!</i>' in terror of what might happen even
now.
</p>

<p>
In the light of the dying flare Bigham caught
George's eye.  His look plainly said: 'You have
thrown these fellows into such a mortal funk
by something you have said, that, at a sign from
you, the crew will take heart and sweep the whole
lot into the sea before they know where they are.'
</p>

<p>
Something like this George read in the mate's
expression, and for one instant he hesitated.  Was
he indeed bound to keep a parole given under such
circumstances?  And then the deeply rooted principles,
early implanted, asserted themselves.  The
word of a gentleman, once passed, even to a 'darned
nigger,' must be sacred.  With an almost imperceptible
shake of the head at Bigham, he turned again
to Te Karearea, whose composure was by this time
restored, and demanded his intentions with regard
to the twice-taken prisoners.
</p>

<p>
Te Karearea, with his head turned aside, laughed
shortly and waved his hand with a gesture implying
that the behaviour of a few foolish Pakehas was
unworthy of his serious consideration, and his men,
quick to understand him, released their hold of the
dejected sailors and allowed them to make their way
below.
</p>

<p>
Truly no great harm had been done in the scuffle,
save for a broken head or two; for the mate and his
men, unarmed as they were&mdash;even their jack-knives
had been taken from them&mdash;had relied upon the
shock of surprise to drive the Maori guards below
and batten them under hatches, among the mass of
sleepers.
</p>

<p>
Even chance could hardly have favoured so stupid
a plan, and, had it not been for Te Karearea's
foreknowledge of the time of the attack, the white men
must have fared ill in the struggle.  As it was, the
Maoris had obeyed orders, and contented themselves
with overpowering their prisoners, while for greater
moral effect they discharged their guns in the air&mdash;to
the infinite danger of George and Te Karearea,
past whom the leaden missiles sang spitefully during
their conversation in the waist.
</p>

<p>
Feeling that he could do no less, George now sought
a fitting compliment upon the generous clemency of
the chief; but, as the latter faced him, there was
something so sinister in the whole aspect of the man,
so basilisk-like was the stare of the stony and, for
once, unwinking eyes, that the young Englishman
thrilled with the conviction that beneath this
seeming forbearance lurked an unsatisfied hate, which
would presently demand a sterner, because belated,
vengeance.
</p>

<p>
He now felt sure that Te Karearea had only held
his hand from a general massacre from interested
motives, and knew that he would not be able to
breathe freely until the Maoris had been set on
shore and gone their way into the interior.
</p>

<p>
Determined to warn Bigham, George sought out
the mate next morning, and to his annoyance found
him already engaged in entertaining the chief with
the few words of Maori he had at command.  These
he eked out by the free use of English, which he
seemed to think was certain to be understood,
provided that each word was delivered in a stentorian
bellow.
</p>

<p>
Te Karearea greeted George very civilly, and smilingly
claimed his services as interpreter.  Presently
he inquired, carelessly enough, what the mate
intended to do after setting him and his Maoris ashore.
George put this question with the greatest reluctance
to the thick-skulled Bigham, who replied with genial
truculence that not only would he raise the countryside
in pursuit, but would take a hand in it himself,
just for the pleasure of having a smack
at the 'brown beast,' as he styled the dignified
chief.
</p>

<p>
George toned down this senseless bombast as far
as he could, but the ill-suppressed sneer upon Te
Karearea's thin lips convinced him that the latter
perfectly understood all that the mate had so absurdly
threatened.  However, the chief laughed heartily,
and, when George at last got Bigham away from him,
the mate would listen to no suggestion of a disguised
ill-will.  But he promised to abstain from further
plotting, and from this George extracted such
comfort as he could.
</p>

<p>
Towards evening George paid a visit to the man
whom he had so mysteriously felled the night before,
and who was reported to be doing well.  He still
carried the greenstone club in his belt, and when he
entered the deck-house&mdash;which had been converted
into a sick-bay&mdash;found Paeroa with a bandaged head
and looking ill and weary, but with a fire in his eye
which argued deep resentment.
</p>

<p>
But to the Englishman's amazement, no sooner
had he crossed the threshold, than Paeroa clasped his
hand in both his own, sank upon one knee, and poured
out a torrent of musically sounding words.
</p>

<p>
'Hortoni, beloved of the gods, master of the <i>mere</i>
of TUMATAUENGA,' he said, 'Te Kaihuia has spoken
with me and has given me a word.  O great one, who
callest up the wind at will, I thank thee for my life;
for surely hadst thou struck to slay, I had been slain.'
</p>

<p>
'Stop!  What are you saying?' interjected George,
but Paeroa's speech flowed on.
</p>

<p>
'Behold now, Hortoni, because thou heldest back
the strong arm of TUMATAUENGA, I will follow thee.
Whithersoever thou goest, be it over the mountain
or along the plain, through the deep forest or in the
green meadows, over the land or across the sea,
whether there be peace, or whether there be war, I
am thy man, and I will follow thee.  Hear now the
word which Paeroa has spoken.'
</p>

<p>
George was wonderstruck, and, though far from
understanding the motives which moved the Maori
to this extraordinary act of self-abasement, was
touched by the poor fellow's sincerity and by his
devotion to one who, however unwittingly, had done him
serious injury.  He knew that it would be utterly
useless to try to disabuse the man of the belief that
he had held back some potent force from destroying
him, so, smiling in his peculiarly engaging way upon
the young Maori, he replied:
</p>

<p>
'O Paeroa, I thank you.  When you get ashore,
you must leave the rascals by whom you are
surrounded, rejoin your tribe, and try to keep out of
trouble for the future.'
</p>

<p>
This speech sounded like bathos after the high-sounding
periods in which the Maori had addressed
him, but Paeroa's sole reply was: 'I have spoken,
Hortoni'; whereupon George, a good deal embarrassed,
wished him a speedy recovery and rather
hurriedly took his leave.
</p>

<p>
Young Haughton was by no means too credulous,
and with regard to the incident of the previous night
had come to the matter-of-fact conclusion that he
must have unlocked his chest and withdrawn the
greenstone club without, in his excitement, noticing
what he was about.  Yet he very clearly recognised
the powerful influence which the tradition of its
origin would exert upon the superstitious Maoris,
and he determined to wear it continually during the
short remainder of his association with them.
</p>

<p>
As he was pacing the deck after his interview with
Paeroa, Te Karearea approached him, and with a
grave salute requested permission to speak with
him upon a matter of importance.
</p>

<p>
The chief lost no time in coming to the point.  For
an instant, as his eyes fell upon the greenstone club,
the same extraordinary change passed over his face
as on the previous day; but he speedily recovered
himself, and in tense, vibrating tones began:
</p>

<p>
'I have a word for you, O Hortoni!'
</p>

<p>
'Say it, friend,' answered George laconically.
</p>

<p>
'There are no lies under my tongue, and my heart
is clean,' pursued the chief.  'Ha!  I am not as the
Pakehas, in whom is nought but guile.  I except you,
my friend.'
</p>

<p>
George bowed.
</p>

<p>
'I will swallow the Pakehas as the sea swallows
the little pebbles upon the shore,' went on the chief.
'War shall there be round about the land until
the last of the accursed race be driven into <i>Moana</i>
(ocean); for God is with me and with them whose
priest I am, and His strength shall dwell in our arms
until we make an end of slaying because there is no
longer a Pakeha to be slain.'
</p>

<p>
His voice rolled and swelled into a chant as the
soft gutturals poured out, an impetuous flood, and
as he paused, glaring at George, his deep-set eyes
flashed, and the expression upon his scarred face was
very grim.
</p>

<p>
'To what end do you speak thus to me, O Chief?'
inquired George.
</p>

<p>
'To this end, Hortoni,' cried the Maori.  'Cast off
the accursed race to whom you have belonged till
now, and come in among us!  Be my Pakeha and the
Pakeha of my <i>hapu</i> (tribe).  So shall we be honoured,
and we will honour you and give you a Maori <i>wahine</i>
(woman) to wife.  Land without measure shall be
yours, and you shall dwell among us as a great chief
in power and peace, until they come to carry you to
Reinga.  This is my word to you, O Hortoni!'
</p>

<p>
'And hear you my word, O insulter of a strong race!'
cried George indignantly.  'Who you are I know not,
nor whose priest you claim to be.  But this I know, O
fool!  The Pakeha is an eagle upon a mountain peak,
and the eagle shall swoop upon the hawk and clutch
it in his mighty talons and rend it into little pieces,
which shall be scattered to the north and to the south
and to the east and to the west.  So shall there be an
end of the stupid hawk.  This is my word to you, O
Te Karearea!'
</p>

<p>
The rage which laid hold of Te Karearea at this
uncompromising rejection of his singular proposal was
so clearly exhibited, that George stepped back a pace
and suggestively dropped his hand upon his greenstone
club.  The chief shrank back at once, controlled
his wrath by a mighty effort, and stalked away, sending
over his shoulder a Parthian shaft in the words:
</p>

<p>
'You may yet dwell many days in my <i>hapu</i>,
Hortoni, before you call the eagle to rend the hawk.'
</p>

<p>
He had no sooner disappeared than George took
himself severely to task for having so completely lost
his temper.  He knew that not a few Maori chiefs
had induced white men&mdash;not of the best sort&mdash;to
attach themselves to their respective tribes and to
become Maoris in all but colour.  Of such degenerate
whites&mdash;Pakeha Maoris they were called[<a id="chap07fn1text"></a><a href="#chap07fn1">1</a>]&mdash;the
possessors were egregiously proud, and great were the
airs they assumed over their less fortunate brethren.
A proposal of this sort to a man of George Haughton's
type was so utterly absurd, that it might well have
been passed over with contempt, instead of having
been met with windy words of wrath.  As for Te
Karearea's own anger, that did not trouble George
in the least.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap07fn1"></a>
[<a href="#chap07fn1text">1</a>] Their influence was not always wholly bad.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
His meditations were cut short by the arrival of a
Maori, who informed him in picturesque language,
that the feet of those who waited to carry Te Kaihuia
to Reinga were without the old man's door, and that
the aged chief had sent to beg Hortoni to come to
him at once, as he had a word for him before he
himself departed for the abode of the shades.
</p>

<p>
Greatly shocked at this totally unexpected news,
George hastened to the spot where lay the withered
form of the venerable chief, who was travelling fast
towards the valley of the great shadow.
</p>

<p>
'O my poor old friend, I am grieved to see you
like this!' cried George.  'What is the matter?  You
were not ill this morning.'
</p>

<p>
The dying chief gasped once or twice and by an
effort raised his hand and pointed, while he mumbled
half-articulate words which smote the listener with
sudden, sickening horror.  For they made it plain
that the old man had been done to death, partly
because his age and weakness would have rendered
him a burden to the rest of the band on their march
through the bush.
</p>

<p>
'Ah, who has done this dastardly thing?' raged
George, angered out of himself at the cruel indifference
to suffering which could so coldly rid itself of
probable embarrassment.
</p>

<p>
Te Kaihuia's attenuated body writhed under the
agony of the poison, and he stared, glassy-eyed, at
George.
</p>

<p>
'Be-ware,' he gasped.  'Be-ware&mdash;Te
... Beware&mdash;the&mdash;Hau&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
The quivering jaw dropped, the palsied head fell
back.  Old Te Kaihuia had gone down to Reinga
with his warning word unspoken.
</p>

<p>
'Thank heaven, we shall make land, and all this
horror will be over by to-morrow night at latest,'
George said gloomily to himself, as he crawled into
his hammock an hour or so after poor old Te
Kaihuia's remains had been dropped overboard.
'The loathsome cruelty of poisoning the harmless
old creature because he was likely to be in their way!
I can't believe that Te Karearea had any hand in
the shameful business.  The chief is high-minded in
his way.  Yet&mdash;oh, what devils men can be! ... What
was it, I wonder, against which the poor old fellow
wished to warn me?'  He fell asleep still wondering.
</p>

<p>
He awoke with a start.  Midnight was just past,
and upon everything lay a great silence, faintly
broken by the soft lap of the sea against the timbers
of the brig as she sped on towards the land
and&mdash;safety?  No other sound was audible in the profound
peace of the night, and yet George was certain that
something had startled his sleep and awakened him.
He sat up cautiously and listened, holding his breath.
Nothing!
</p>

<p>
Then with frightful suddenness the solemn stillness
was stirred by a sound&mdash;a sound discordant, shrill,
horrible; a sound which pierced the heart of the
watcher in the night, chilling his blood, so that, for all
his strength and hardihood, he shook and shivered
as he heard the hideous tones, inhuman yet resonant
of human sadness and hate and fury; appalling in
their horror.  And as George sat quaking in his
hammock, the weird noises, only half articulate,
crashed again through the stillness, stunning his
affrighted ears.
</p>

<p>
What was that strange, revolting, heart-sickening
noise?  What was it?  Like the howling of a pack
of wild dogs, where no dogs could be.  Like the
shrieking and sobbing of men in dire agony&mdash;yet
what human throat ever emitted such sounds?  Like
the hoots and jeers of gibbering maniacs.  Like none
of these alone.  Like all of them together.  What
human ear was ever forced to listen to such inhuman
sounds?  And at such an hour, too!  What were
they?
</p>

<p>
By an immense effort George got to the floor.
Bigham was muttering fearfully in his hammock,
two of the men were sobbing with fright, and one
prayed brokenly, his scattered wits recalling fragments
of the simple petitions of his childhood.  Over
all there hung the shadow of the same awful
terror.
</p>

<p>
Once more that horrible wailing swept down from
above.
</p>

<p>
'Bigham, I can't stand this,' said George in a harsh
whisper.  'I am going on deck to find out what it
means.'
</p>

<p>
The mate only groaned.  Then manhood reasserting
its grip, 'Don't go, Mr. Haughton,' he implored.
'The devil, I think, is let loose up there.  Come back,
sir, for God's sake!'
</p>

<p>
But George was already half-way up the ladder.
Unless he took this thing on the rush, he felt that he
would have no nerve to face it at all.  He reached
the companion, held back an instant while he fetched
a deep breath, and then sprang into the open.
</p>

<p>
Not a soul was to be seen.  A lantern or two shed
a faint glimmering light, the helm was lashed, the
deck empty of life.
</p>

<p>
With a gasp of horror George turned and raced
back to the shelter of the fo'c'sle.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap08"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VIII
<br /><br />
THE STORM BURSTS
</h3>

<p>
The gloom which hung over the fo'c'sle when day at
length dawned was in no wise lightened by the
futility of all efforts to discover the cause of the
weird sounds of the night.  George was, perhaps,
the only one who had not actually attributed the
discordant din to a supernatural source; but since
more than one uncommonly odd happening had
chanced of late, even he would have found it a
relief to be assured upon one point, no matter what.
</p>

<p>
As the day wore towards evening and the <i>Stella</i>
neared the coast, the Maoris crowded into the bows,
laughing and singing, as the deep blue line of hills
gradually took on natural colours, and showed as
forest-clad slopes, fronted by bare, frowning cliffs.
Nor were the whites less elated at the approach of
the hour of parting, for they were anxious to be
relieved of an enforced service, not only irksome in
itself, but grown to be fraught with positive danger.
</p>

<p>
Te Karearea intended to disembark shortly before
sunset at Whareongaonga, a point some fifteen miles
south of the Bay of Turanga, or Poverty Bay, as
Captain Cook had named it, and thence to march
inland and disappear in the dense bush which stretched
for miles towards the north.  As if to forestall any
tricks on the part of the white sailors, the brig was
kept swinging from one tack to the other all through
the afternoon, keeping always a couple of miles off
shore, and George, who was using his eyes, liked the
look of things less and less; for all the men of the
chief's company, fully armed, kept the deck during
the whole of the day.  Seizing an opportunity, he
communicated his fears to Bigham.
</p>

<p>
'Pooh!  You're always looking for bogies, Mr. 'Aughton,'
was the mate's sneering reply.  'You don't
see me grizzling.'
</p>

<p>
'You were not very far from grizzling, as you call
it, last night,' George was stung to retort.
</p>

<p>
'That was very different,' protested the mate,
flushing through his weather-beaten skin.  You
weren't too keen yourself about going on deck.'
</p>

<p>
'You are right,' George admitted frankly.  'I don't
think that I ever was so frightened in my life&mdash;and
by a <i>mere</i> sound, too.'
</p>

<p>
This conquered Bigham.  'Well, you didn't act so,'
he said; 'and that sound was worse than any
flesh-and-blood thing, however terrifying.  Yet you faced
it, whatever it was.  No,' affirmed Bigham; 'I never
meant to hint as you was wanting in pluck, sir.  All
I meant was as I don't think the niggers will try on
any games, for I judge they'll be only too glad to get
rid of us.
</p>

<p>
George assented, but without conviction.
</p>

<p>
'Any way, sir, you'll admit they haven't treated us
as bad as might have been expected.'  He made a
wry face, recollecting his recent failure.
</p>

<p>
'True; but even at the eleventh hour they could
hardly have got on without us, had the weather
changed, or&mdash;&mdash;  However, let that go.  One thing I
will ask of you.  Should any of them offer provocation,
take no notice.  All we want is to be well rid
of them.'
</p>

<p>
'You are right, sir,' assented Bigham; 'and you
have been right all along.  I'll  warn the
men.'  Which, for a Lancashire man, was a very notable
surrender.
</p>

<p>
Greatly relieved, George turned from the mate
to find Te Karearea at his elbow, all smiles and
courtesy.  'We part soon, Hortoni,' he began, 'and
the Maori will again set foot in his own land,
whence the Pakeha unjustly drove him.'
</p>

<p class="capcenter">

<br />

<br />
George turned from the mate to find Te Karearea at his elbow. (page 79).
</p>

<p>
Resentment still smouldered in George at the
insolent proposal made to him, but, mindful of his
own advice to Bigham, he answered lightly: 'Possibly
the Pakeha may endeavour to repeat his performance.'
</p>

<p>
'When a bird has screamed to the eagle the whereabouts
of the hawk?' queried the chief, grinning.
</p>

<p>
'Oh, let us have peace for the short time we are to
be together,' pleaded George.  'You have not treated
us badly.  We will remember that and forget the rest.'
</p>

<p>
'So be it,' agreed the chief, and took himself off as
he had come, smiling.
</p>

<p>
The hour arrived at last, and the brig, after a final
tack, stood in close to the shore and dropped her
anchor.  The boats were got away and the women
rowed ashore, but George noticed with misgiving
that the men were distributed in scattered groups
among the sailors, six or seven to each white man.
He himself was separated by some ten feet or so
from the nearest man of his own colour, and between
them were as many Maoris.  Bigham was leaning on
the starboard rail, endeavouring to chat with those
about him; but the brown men paid little heed to
what he said, for their eyes were ever screwing this
way and that, and their faces wore the strained,
expectant look of those who await an assured crisis.
</p>

<p>
Staring hard at Bigham, George managed to flash
an eye-signal, 'Be on your guard!' and the mate
stiffened from his lounging attitude and laid his
hand carelessly upon a belaying pin.  Nearer and
nearer drew the returning boats, and at last, as they
grated against the side, Te Karearea, who had been
leaning contemplatively against the mainmast, raised
his right hand.
</p>

<p>
For one instant there was tense silence.  Then this
was shattered by a wild and deafening yell, which
the hills gave back in a hundred diminishing echoes,
and, as the Maoris rushed towards the side, a young
chief, Te Pouri&mdash;the Melancholy One&mdash;stumbled
heavily against one of the sailors.  The man
retaliated with a sweep of his arm which sent Te Pouri
reeling backwards into collision with a second seaman.
This one, taking his cue from his messmate, shoved
the Maori forward with such violence that he must
have fallen, but for the support of the crowd into
which he dived.
</p>

<p>
The incident passed in a flash, but as Te Pouri
recovered his balance, another yell arose&mdash;this time a
howl of hate, charged with the lust of vengeance
long deferred&mdash;and in a moment sharp spears stabbed
this way and that, piercing the shrinking flesh, while
club and axe, whirled aloft by sinewy arms, fell with
sickening thud upon the yielding bone.
</p>

<p>
The man who had heedlessly begun the trouble
was the first to go down, split from crown to chin by
a terrible stroke of Te Pouri's long-handled
tomahawk.  Then George, who for a second had stood in
frozen horror at the awful suddenness of the change,
leaped into the press, striking right and left with
his fists.
</p>

<p>
Even in the hot excitement of the fight, he noticed
with dull surprise that the Maoris merely ducked to
avoid, or warded off his blows as best they could,
without attempting to harm him.  Ahead of him he
could see Bigham, belaying-pin in hand, smashing a
path through the packed brown forms, while, ringing
high above the din of conflict, he heard the voice of Te
Karearea shrieking to his men to hold their hands.
</p>

<p>
But George had scant time for observation, or for
thought over the inexplicable attitude of Te Karearea,
whom he had certainly credited with engineering
this massacre; for scarcely had he rushed into
the thick of the fray, than he was pulled down upon
his back and pinned to the deck by sheer weight of
numbers.
</p>

<p>
The next thing he saw was his greenstone club in
the hands of Te Karearea, who grinned at him,
crying: 'Fear nought, Hortoni.  I will stop these
dogs in their worrying.'  With which he bounded
into the fight, aiming a blow at one of his own men
which would certainly have left the fellow few brains
to think with, had he not ducked at the critical
moment, with the result that Te Karearea's <i>mere</i>,
cleaving the air downwards, met with terrific shock
the upward sweep of Bigham's belaying-pin.
</p>

<p>
So severe was the jar, that the club, unsecured by
its wrist-loop, flew out of Te Karearea's hand over the
side, and fell into the water, just as Bigham, last
survivor of the miserable crew, leaped through the open
gangway into the sea.  There was an instant swirl
of lithe black bodies below the surface, and with a
shrill yell the mate sank beneath the waves and was
seen no more.
</p>

<p>
With a loud cry of wrath and despair Te Karearea
rushed to the gangway, and at his word a dozen tall
fellows sprang upon the rail and made ready to dive
after the <i>mere</i>.  But a number of dark, triangular
fins rose slowly to the surface, and the men instantly
jumped to the deck, nor could all Te Karearea's
prayers and threats avail to induce them to risk
entering Reinga through such dreadful portals.
Whereupon, the chief sullenly ordered half a dozen
of them into a boat with instructions to drag the
sea-bottom until the greenstone club should be recovered.
First, however, the dead bodies of the sailors, along
with the corpse of an old Maori, who had been
somehow crushed to death in the fight, were hove
overboard, and shortly afterwards guns were fired into
the water, the surface flogged with oars, and hideous
noises raised to scare away the watchful sharks,
which was now less difficult to do.  But, though
dredgers and divers did their best, the whereabouts
of the <i>mere</i> remained undiscovered.
</p>

<p>
The whole terrible scene had been enacted with
frightful swiftness, and, notwithstanding Te Karearea's
apparent efforts to restrain his men, and his
solicitude for his captive's welfare&mdash;which the latter
was far from understanding&mdash;George felt convinced
that the crafty Maori was at the bottom of this and
the other tragedies which had marked the ill-omened
voyage of the <i>Stella</i>.
</p>

<p>
While the interest of all was centred upon those
who were searching for the greenstone <i>mere</i>, George
became conscious of a lightening of the top-weights,
and instantly put all his strength into an upward
heave, which sent the fellow who was sitting upon
him rolling on the deck, while, at the same moment,
he jerked himself free from the others, sprang up,
and made a dash for the gangway.
</p>

<p>
With loud yells the Maoris closed in upon him
from all sides, but, though the odds were all against
him, the Englishman's fighting blood was up; he
struck hard and fast, and Te Pouri received such a
tremendous blow in the eye, that he danced and
howled with the agony of it.  An instant later, with
a look of fiendish malignity, he swept through the
press and came upon George from behind.
</p>

<p>
Within striking distance he stopped, swung up and
poised the cruel tomahawk, ready for the smashing
downstroke which would have crashed through scalp
and skull and brain, when a piercing yell was heard,
and George, glancing in the direction of the sound,
saw Te Karearea bounding towards him, spear in rest.
</p>

<p>
Instinctively the young man swerved to one side
as far as the close-packed throng would allow, and
the movement saved his life.  For just then the
tomahawk smashed downwards, missing his head by
a bare inch, while the flat of it, fortunately, struck
his shoulder with such force as to send his arm numb
to his side, and bring him to his knees.
</p>

<p>
He was confusedly aware of swiftly parting brown
bodies before the onrush of the chief; he heard the
soft thud of impact between spear and flesh, a loud
scream of mortal agony, and then the sky was
blotted out from his dazed eyes as a heavy body
toppled upon him, crushing him down, and forcing
his head with fearful violence against the deck.
Then for a space he knew no more.
</p>

<p>
No one ventured to protest against this summary
execution; for their chief's word was law, and they
knew it.  All were aware that Te Pouri had disobeyed
Te Karearea's order that, at whatever cost, Hortoni
should be spared, and, as death was the penalty of
disobedience, death, swift and inexorable, had been
meted out to him.
</p>

<p>
When George came to his senses some hours later,
he was in a litter, being carried he knew not whither;
but, though it was too dark to make out details, it
was clear that the coast had been left behind, and
that Te Karearea had set out for his destination&mdash;wherever
that might be&mdash;under the friendly cover of
night.
</p>

<p>
As the dreadful scenes of the past afternoon came
vividly back to him, the ghastly memories so
distressed George that presently he became feverish,
moving restlessly upon his litter, and reviewing in
mild delirium the varied events of the voyage and
its horrible conclusion.  But ere long the tangled
skein of thought knotted suddenly, and, soothed by
the pure, fragrant air of the bush, the gentle,
swinging motion, and the soft, monotonous chant of the
bearers, he fell into a sound, refreshing sleep.
</p>

<p>
Morning at length shot up over the tall pines
which rose erect and towering without a branch for
a hundred feet and more, and the litter was set down
at the base of a gigantic tree-fern, whose bright
green fronds spread tent-wise over the invalid, who
still slept, unaware of the gentle hands which now,
as at intervals during the march, renewed the
cool dressings which had soothed his pain and
calmed his shaken brain.
</p>

<p>
But when George at last opened his eyes, a pretty
Maori girl came running up, and with great solicitude
inquired after his welfare.  The young man thanked
her and tried to rise, but fell back, giddy and
confused, whereupon the girl renewed the dressings and
warned him to lie still until breakfast was ready.
He followed her sound advice, and, when he had
eaten what he could of the food she presently served
upon wooden platters, felt decidedly better.
</p>

<p>
The Maoris had marched throughout the greater
part of the night, and now they sprawled upon the
soft green grass in restful attitudes, some of them
asleep, others busily oiling the locks of the rifles
and revolvers they had looted from the brig, while
others again were breakfasting and chatting with a
light-hearted gaiety which gave little suggestion of
the bloody drama of the previous day.
</p>

<p>
As his mind cleared George began to review his
position.  His weakness made it imperative that he
should rest for the present, but he determined to
escape as soon as possible, and, after communicating
with his father&mdash;whose anxiety, he felt, must by this
time be very great&mdash;hunt up Terence's regiment
and enlist without attracting the notice of Colonel
Cranstoun.  Failing this last, he would join the
Rangers&mdash;but first of all he must get away.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly the maze of thought into which he had
wandered took a new turn, for he remembered to
have seen Te Karearea charging down upon him
with levelled spear.  Why, then, had the chief
turned the point of the weapon aside?  He was
sorely puzzled to discover the reason.  Of course he
had no knowledge of the death of Te Pouri at the
hands of the chief; but, even had he known of it, the
mystery would only have deepened.
</p>

<p>
His reflections were cut short by the arrival of
Te Karearea himself, who saluted his prisoner in his
customary courteous and dignified way, and sincerely
hoped that none but the most trifling consequences
would ensue from the injuries he had received.
</p>

<p>
Notwithstanding the disgust with which the chief
inspired him, for he believed him to be a wholesale
murderer, George had too much tact to show his
feelings, and so, perhaps, ruin his chances.  So he
replied politely to the chief's greeting.
</p>

<p>
'But I am not very clear about it all,' he added;
'for the last thing I recall is the sight of you rushing
at me with a levelled spear.  So how&mdash;how&mdash;&mdash;' he
shook his head, bewildered.
</p>

<p>
Te Karearea grinned at this, and hailing one of
his lieutenants who was passing, said:
</p>

<p>
'Speak, O Winata Pakaro, and tell Hortoni what
befell as the light went out of his eyes.  I tell not the
tale, Hortoni, for I know that you distrust me&mdash;not
without reason, perhaps, from your point of view.'  He
nodded to his subordinate, who drew for George
a vivid word-picture of the events which had
accompanied his downfall.
</p>

<p>
George had no choice but to believe the story, and
he felt completely mystified.  Why should the
possession of him be accounted so precious that even the
life of a valuable fighting-man was not allowed to
weigh down the scale against it?
</p>

<p>
But Te Karearea dismissed Winata Pakaro and
broke in upon his thoughts with a question which
sent flying what little power of comprehension was
left to him.  'Have you yet recovered your <i>mere</i>,
Hortoni?' the chief inquired blandly.
</p>

<p>
George stared up at him.  'Are my wits wandering
again?' he said.  'Do you seriously ask that
question?  You know as well as I do that the
greenstone club went to the bottom of the sea.'
</p>

<p>
'Nevertheless, I ask you whether you have yet
recovered it,' persisted the chief; whereat George,
weakened by his accident, grew peevish.  'Am I
then a magician, O Te Karearea?' he snapped
back.
</p>

<p>
Te Karearea's rich brown skin turned curiously
sallow, and he recoiled a step.  'Far be it from me
to offend you, Hortoni,' he said submissively.  'You
are not a wizard if you say you are not.  I do but
ask if you have got back your <i>mere</i>?'
</p>

<p>
'Why, you are saying it again!' roared George,
whose head was aching with the strain of so much
excitement.  'Are you mad that you bother me with
such stupid questions?  Do you think that I have the
thing about me?  Wizard be hanged!  I know your
supersti&mdash;&mdash;  Eh!  What!  Well, I never!  Here!  Hi!
Come back, Chief!'  For Te Karearea, offended, or
scared, by this unusual outburst, was stalking off.
</p>

<p>
At George's hail he turned again, hesitated, and
then hastened eagerly to his captive's side.
</p>

<p>
As for George, his face was a study.  The most
unbounded astonishment expressed itself in every
line as he half-sat, half-reclined, with the <i>mere</i> of
TUMATAUENGA laid loosely across his open palms.
</p>

<p>
'I know no more than you do where it came from,'
he said, looking up helplessly at the chief.
</p>

<p>
'Oh, of course not,' sneered Te Karearea.  'May be
RANGI cast it into your lap, or perchance
TUMATAUENGA came and gave it you just now when my
back was turned.  Anything is possible, for there
it lies.'
</p>

<p>
Te Karearea'a face had grown hideous to behold.
He rolled his eyes until they appeared to be turned
inside out, he poked out his tongue until it nearly
touched his chest, while bitter words came in labouring
grunts, as he shook his crooked hands impotently
in the air.  At last by a mighty effort he controlled
himself.  'But I knew that it would return,' he
muttered.  'Yes; I was sure of it.'
</p>

<p>
George, though utterly bewildered, was quick to
see the advantage which the recovery of the club
carried with it, and now rather regretted that he
had so openly shown his astonishment.  However,
he was quite safe in that regard, for, not to put too
fine a point upon it, Te Karearea regarded his
disclaimer as a lie told for some personal reason, and
the appearance of the <i>mere</i> itself as evidence of
strong magical powers on the part of Hortoni.
</p>

<p>
He was intensely annoyed that, once having gained
possession of the beautiful, mystic weapon, he should
have lost it; but he had his game to play, and it was
no part of it to quarrel with his prisoner.  So he
changed the subject, and, reverting to the question
of parole, said:
</p>

<p>
'Give me your word again, Hortoni, and you shall
go out and come in among us as though you were
really one of ourselves.'
</p>

<p>
'I am obliged to you,' George returned sourly, not
overpleased with the compliment, which smacked
rather too strongly of the Pakeha-Maori.  But he
concluded to agree, since he could not hope to escape
until he had regained his strength, and so replied:
</p>

<p>
'I give you my parole for one week.  At the end of
that time we will talk again.'
</p>

<p>
And Te Karearea, perforce content with this,
withdrew.
</p>

<p>
Quite exhausted by all the excitement he had gone
through, and knowing that his coveted greenstone
was safe while the aroma of present magic clung to
it, George lay down once more, and, after vainly
trying to explain how that which he had seen falling
into the sea should be found beneath his mats,
once more forgot his puzzles and his troubles in
sleep.
</p>

<p>
He slept almost all round the clock, awaking next
morning considerably later than the sun.  The march
had evidently been resumed during his long
unconsciousness, and the litter was now set behind a
boulder on the top of a small hill, below which
dense bush spread out over a succession of smaller
mounds to the valley.  Food and water had been
placed near him, but not a Maori could be seen.
</p>

<p>
George, having breakfasted, felt much better,
though still stiff and sore, and presently the unusual
silence and absence of all signs of life struck him
oddly, and he began to look about him.
</p>

<p>
'What can have become of all my rascals?' he
wondered, and just then the silence was stirred by a
long wailing cry, which rose and fell plaintively on
the still air.  'A <i>weka</i>[<a id="chap08fn1text"></a><a href="#chap08fn1">1</a>] calling to its mate,' thought
George, as the melancholy note sounded again in the
depths of the valley.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap08fn1"></a>
[<a href="#chap08fn1text">1</a>] <i>Ocydromus australis</i>, the wood-hen.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
He began somewhat stiffly to descend the hill,
when he was startled by a harsh, imperative whisper
close beside him: 'Lie down, Hortoni!  Quick, lie
down!'
</p>

<p>
Then, as he stared this way and that, seeing no
one, a lithe brown form rose from the other side of
the rock beside which he stood, compelled him with
heavy hand to the ground, and sank out of sight as
swiftly and noiselessly as it had arisen.
</p>

<p>
And as George, obedient to the pressure upon his
shoulder, crouched under the rock, a bullet flattened
itself with sulky smack upon the face of the boulder
behind him, while, even as it dropped to the ground,
the crack of a rifle floated up from the valley.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap09"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER IX
<br /><br />
JUST IN TIME
</h3>

<p>
'A clever marksman,' thought George, as he
snuggled behind his rock.  'If I hadn't been pulled
down, I should have handed in my parole for good
and all.'
</p>

<p>
He drew a deep breath.  He had courage enough
to admit that he had been scared.
</p>

<p>
Smack!  Another bullet lodged close by; but this
time there was an abrupt, dull thud, followed by a
heavy groan, while a commotion further up the hill
told all too plainly of a human form writhing in
agony.
</p>

<p>
'<i>Habet!</i>' muttered George.  'Whatever is all the
rumpus about?  Some settlers, perhaps, have heard
of our arrival and come out to stop us.  What clever
beggars these Maoris are at taking cover!  I could
not see a sign of one when I was up.'  He twisted his
head and stared down into the valley; but, seeing
nothing for his pains, peered round the back of his
sheltering rock.
</p>

<p>
<a id="p93"></a>
There lay Winata Pakaro, famous fighting chief,
his lips set in a grin of hate, his eyes glittering with
the light of battle, his long hair stirred by the breeze
as the locks of the Furies by their writhing snakes.
Suddenly his rifle sprang to his shoulder, and George,
forgetful of his own danger, lifted his head by ever
so little over the rock to watch the effect of the shot.
</p>

<p>
In a moment the explosion roared in his ear; but
there was no one to be seen in the valley.  Only,
almost simultaneously with the report of Winata's
rifle, the gloom of the distant scrub was rent by a
vivid flash, and George ducked again as the bullet
came singing up to smash the stock of the Maori's
gun and glance off up the hill.
</p>

<p>
'<i>Na!</i>' grunted the disgusted Winata Pakaro, and
called softly to a comrade, who glided out of the
bushes, not three feet from George, who, till then,
had not the slightest idea that any one lay there.
Winata explained his wants, and the other, whose
business it was to keep in touch with the firing-line,
crawled off as a fourth bullet grazed Pakaro's shoulder.
</p>

<p>
The hardy savage merely grunted, took another
rifle from the hand of his comrade, and stretched
himself out as before.
</p>

<p>
A crash, a groan, and, as the report of a fifth
shot came from the valley, the powder-monkey, so
to call him, fell upon his face, and lay still with a
hole in his head.  He had imitated George in peering
over the rock, and now there he was&mdash;dead.
</p>

<p>
'I know only one man who can shoot like this,'
thought George,' and he must be a good bit east of
here.'  Another bullet knocked fragments from the
top of the rock.  'He has got our range to a nicety.
I wish he would turn his polite attention to some
other part of the hill.  Ah!  I thought so.  It is
getting too hot here.'  For with the sound of the last shot
Winata Pakaro glided away, giving a quick call to
George to follow cautiously.
</p>

<p>
Ten minutes later a couple of Maoris stood as if by
magic at his side, wound each an arm through his
own, and, with their rifles at the trail, set off with
him at a terrific pace down the hill.
</p>

<p>
Difficult as it was, George managed to snatch a
fleeting glance or two as he tore along between his
guards.  On this side the Maoris were running at top
speed, their objective being another hill, a natural
fortress, which rose out of the valley a mile or so
away.  On that side, a mob of whites and friendly
Maoris, far inferior in number to Te Karearea's force,
were racing desperately towards the same hill, but
wasting their breath in shouts and yells.  But so far
it was anybody's race.
</p>

<p>
'Let go!' panted George.  'I can run faster alone.'
</p>

<p>
'No tricks then, Hortoni,' growled one of the
guards.  'Try to escape and we will brain you.'
</p>

<p>
Stimulated by the occasional shots which followed
them, they swept along in fine style.  As they neared
the coveted hill, Te Karearea's Maoris converged
upon it from all sides, and simply over-ran a score
or so of whites who opposed them, braining one and
wounding half a dozen others.
</p>

<p>
The hill gained, George flung himself upon his
back, too blown to heed the bullets which whistled
over him; but, as one of them passed uncomfortably
close to his head, he crawled behind a rock to watch
the progress of operations.
</p>

<p>
But the sharp excitement was over for the time,
and the long day wore to an end with nothing but
desultory fire upon either side, for the whites refused
to cross a ravine, over which it would have been
death to charge.  The fine marksman of the morning
was now conspicuous by his absence, and George
wondered regretfully whether he was the man who
had been carried feet first towards the camp of the
whites after their one ineffectual charge upon the hill.
</p>

<p>
But towards evening the captain of the white force
was startled by the sound of a Maori bugle in his
rear, and, caught thus between two fires, resolved
upon a desperate charge.  He encountered no resistance
as he led his men across the dangerous ravine;
but, as he ran on, a stream of fire belched from the
heart of a bush, and he had, literally, a close shave,
for one of his whiskers was singed completely off.
So he retired a sadder and less hirsute man,
only to find that the astute Te Karearea had raided
his camp and annexed his reserve of ammunition,
along with all his horses, accoutrements, stores, and
baggage.
</p>

<p>
This calamity finished the gallant officer, who
retreated throughout the night over terrible country,
with his weary and dispirited column at his heels,
ammunitionless and supperless.
</p>

<p>
They were not pursued; for the Maoris themselves
were tired and hungry, and preferred to set about
the preparation of a well-earned meal.  For even
though a man fight in a bad cause, he yet gets up
appetite enough to enjoy his dinner.
</p>

<p>
Wrath and disappointment at the result of the
fight had made George unusually sullen, but when
the pretty maid who had so deftly bandaged him,
and whose musical name was Kawainga, or Star of
the Dawn, brought him supper, his sufferings, less
poignant than his appetite, did not compel him
to refuse.
</p>

<p>
A hungry man is an angry man, and certainly
when George had eaten all the good things set before
him, and smoked a looted cigar&mdash;Te Karearea with
generous irony had sent him a handful&mdash;his temporary
irritation vanished, and his usual cool temper
reasserted itself.  He had plenty of common-sense,
and recognising that there was nothing to be gained
by quarrelling with the chief, presently accepted the
latter's invitation to stroll round the camp and visit
the pickets.  For Te Karearea observed all proper
military precautions, and maintained an iron
discipline in camp and field.
</p>

<p>
'It would be no easy matter for a Pakeha to break
through my lines, Hortoni,' he remarked, as they
turned again towards the bivouac.
</p>

<p>
'If you are hinting at me, I have no intention of
trying,' was George's reply to this suggestive remark.
'But why are you so anxious to detain me?'
</p>

<p>
'Why are you so anxious to leave me, my friend?'
countered the Maori, and, as George burst out laughing,
'I have not treated you ill, Hortoni,' he added
rather wistfully.
</p>

<p>
'True.  Still, you talk as a fool.  Home, friends,
duty, inclination, all call me away from you.  You
are in arms against the men of my race.  Is it any
wonder that I fret in the toils?'
</p>

<p>
'Yet there are chiefs who have their Pakehas,'
urged Te Karearea.
</p>

<p>
'That is not much to the credit of those Pakehas,'
George said loftily; and to change the subject went
on: 'Where is Paeroa?'
</p>

<p>
'Be wise in time, Hortoni,' the chief urged
earnestly.  'You possess, though you do not realise it, a
certain means of attaining greatness.  Ascend the
ladder which I am holding for you, and you will be
great.  Refuse, and you are doomed, even as your
race is doomed.  You ask for Paeroa.  He is gone to
carry the message of my coming.'
</p>

<p>
'And who will listen to it?' George asked dryly.
</p>

<p>
'Say rather, who will not hear my word?'  Te
Karearea drew himself up proudly.  'Waikato and
Ngatiawa shall hear and flock to my standard.
Taranaki and Wanganui shall lift the spear and
shake the tomahawk.  Taupo and Ngaiterangi,
Whakatoea and Ngatiporou, Ngatiapa and Ngatihau[<a id="chap09fn1text"></a><a href="#chap09fn1">1</a>]&mdash;all
these and more shall hear and come with club
and gun.  But Arawa, the accursed, shall be deaf,
and them and the Pakehas shall my legions smite
and slay until the land which has been ours since
Maui drew it forth from the sea, is ours once again.
Behold!  I, Te Karearea, have sworn it.'
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap09fn1"></a>
[<a href="#chap09fn1text">1</a>] All the Maori tribes named above were in arms against the
British at one time or another during the wars.  The Arawas were
friendly.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The sonorous cadence of vowels rolled out into the
night, and George, to his surprise, felt a passing
throb of sympathy for this uncrowned king.  After
all, the land had originally&mdash;and not so long
ago&mdash;belonged to the Maori; nor could the Pakeha be said
to be altogether clean-handed in the matter.  It was
a fleeting mood; but it sufficed to induce George to
let the chief down gently, and to refrain from further
argument.
</p>

<p>
Just then the rapid beat of a horse's hoofs was
heard, and Te Karearea, with a word of excuse to
George, ran back to the sentry they had just passed,
whispered an order, and at once rejoined his guest, as
he was pleased to style his paroled prisoner.
</p>

<p>
'During the afternoon I learned that the captain
of the force opposed to me sent to Turanga for
reinforcements,' he began, smiling.  'This, in all
probability, is the messenger returning.  I am going
to catch him.'
</p>

<p>
'But,' objected George, 'if the messenger recognise
that the sentry is not a "friendly," he will bolt,
and then your man will certainly shoot him.'
</p>

<p>
'It takes some education for a Pakeha to distinguish,
let us say, Arawa from Ngatiawa,' said Te
Karearea reassuringly.  'No; there will be no
difficulty&mdash;of that sort.'  He paused to whisper
instructions to a sentry on the inner ring, and George,
glancing back, saw that the messenger was slowly
walking his tired horse towards the picket.
</p>

<p>
'I must ask you to retire, Hortoni,' said Te
Karearea courteously.  'I must examine this man,
and&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, quite so,' agreed George.  'The poor beggar
little dreams what is in store for him.  When your
interrogation is at an end, turn him over to me, and
I will do my best to console him.'  He nodded to the
chief and turned his back upon the bivouac, thinking
as he went of the grim jest which Fate was about to
play upon the unlucky messenger.
</p>

<p>
Hoping to get a bit of news on his own account,
George strolled towards the outer picket, and in
course of time was challenged by the sentry in the
strictly orthodox manner: 'Halt!  Who goes there?'
</p>

<p>
George explained, and handed the sentry a plug of
tobacco, off which the Maori promptly bit a piece.
But he was a surly fellow, and gave a gruff negative
when asked if he happened to know anything of the
Pakeha who had ridden into the camp.
</p>

<p>
'They will eat the oyster and throw away the shell;
that's all I know,' he growled, his answer showing
that he came from the coast.
</p>

<p>
'Meaning, I suppose, that they will turn him out
of the camp when they have learned all that he has
to tell,' commented George.  'I should like a word
with him before he goes.  I wonder if he will come
this way.'
</p>

<p>
'<i>Whakatore Atua!</i>' (the gods forbid) ejaculated
the sentry, with a nervous glance over his shoulder.
'Let him take another road to Reinga.  I want no
ghosts on my beat.'
</p>

<p>
'Ghosts?  Reinga?' echoed George amazed.  And
then, as the full significance of the Maori's words
came home to him, he turned and sped like the wind
towards the bivouac, a prayer in his heart that he
might reach it in time.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile the messenger, a sturdy young fellow
in the orthodox red coat of the service, had led his
horse to the bivouac of the head chiefs.
</p>

<p>
'I have come to the wrong place, it seems,' he said
cheerfully, little imagining how true were his words.
'It is Captain Westrupp's bivouac I'm after.  Well,
boys, I suppose you licked those rascals?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes; we licked them,' answered Winata Pakaro in
fluent English, while his leader remained unobtrusively
in the background.  'They are now in full
retreat.'
</p>

<p>
'Hurrah!  Well, I must hunt up the captain.
Where is his bivouac?'  He cast a longing eye upon
the cold viands, scattered about.
</p>

<p>
'Nay; sit and eat,' invited Winata Pakaro.  'You
need food after your long ride.  The captain is not
in the camp, nor is it likely that he will return
to-night.'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, in that case, here goes'; and the young soldier
sat down and ate with appetite, while Winata Pakaro
pumped him dry of information as to the number
and disposal of the British and Colonial troops.  The
meal and the interrogation ended together.
</p>

<p>
'Thank you, boys; you are the real old sort,' said
the messenger gratefully.  'Now tell me where my
mates are camped.  It is odd that none of them are
about; but I suppose they are all dog-tired.'
</p>

<p>
He turned to go, smiling at them; but at a sign
from Winata his arms were pinioned, and while a
couple of Maoris held him in a firm grip, a third
lashed his ankles together.
</p>

<p>
He was very strong, that was evident; but he was
intelligent too, and did not waste his strength in
useless struggles.  'You crafty demons!' he snarled
at them.  'You are Te Karearea's men.'
</p>

<p>
'Yes,' admitted Winata Pakaro,' and we are also
brothers of the men who died to-day.  So there is a
blood-feud, and, as we have you, you must die.'
</p>

<p>
'You will not dare to kill a prisoner of war.'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, we will do all things as they ought to be done,
and follow the rules of war.  You come by night
into our camp, pretending to take us for "friendlies,"
and endeavour to worm information out of us.  Thus
you are proved a spy.  It is the custom of civilised
nations at war to hang spies.  Good!  We will hang
you, and so escape the vengeance of the Pakeha.'  His
saturnine chuckle was echoed by the chiefs who
stood in a semi-circle about the prisoner.
</p>

<p>
The unhappy soldier looked round despairingly.
What hope was there for him?  Before him a crescent
of stern-faced men, and all about him men of the
same colour, with faces yet more fierce and horrid.
For the rank and file had gathered to hear the last
of the discussion&mdash;to see the last of the Pakeha.
</p>

<p>
At a sign from Winata Pakaro two grim-visaged
warriors stepped forward with a rope, one end of
which they cast over the stout limb of a great tree.
The other end, which was noosed, they slipped over
the head of the prisoner, who, pale as death, but
erect and brave, gave them back glance for glance.
</p>

<p>
He was a soldier, and he would not show the
despair he felt to these enemies of his flag.  'I warn
you that a terrible vengeance will be taken if you
murder me,' he said boldly.
</p>

<p>
A derisive yell arose among the bystanders, and at
a covert sign one of the executioners drew the rope
taut, handing the loose end to the other.
</p>

<p>
The miserable messenger gave up hope.  He was
brave, and he did not mean to go out of the world
like a craven.  But it was hard, for he was young
and strong, and life glowed in his veins.  He cast
an agonised glance around, but only savage, grinning
faces met his eyes.  He closed them, murmuring a
prayer, when a shout, not far off, struck his tense
nerves with such a shock that they quivered, like
harp-strings suddenly smitten, and for the first time
he trembled&mdash;not with fear, but with hope.
</p>

<p>
Again that shout, loud and insistent, crying something
in Maori which he could not understand.  Yet
when he heard it, he trembled all the more, for there
was something in the voice which rang familiar in
his ears.  Yet how could that be?
</p>

<p>
Once more the frantic appeal: '<i>Kei whakamate ia
koe!</i>&mdash;Do not kill him!  Do not kill him!'
</p>

<p>
Stamping footsteps, crushing down the rustling
fern&mdash;nearer, louder, furious at the feeble opposition.
And at last a man, panting, sobbing for breath, burst
into the open space illumined by the bivouac fire,
gasping as he came his ever-recurring '<i>Kei
whakamate ia koe!</i>'
</p>

<p>
For one instant the soldier stared, incredulous.
He seemed paralysed.  His eyes started from his
head.  His limbs shook under him.  Suddenly he
felt the tightening noose, stiffened, caught at a hasty
breath, and spent it in a quavering shriek: '<i>George!
Quick!  They're murdering me!</i>'
</p>

<p>
The two Maoris with the rope set off at a run.
But ere the cord could press the swelling throat,
George Haughton crashed through the encircling
crowd, tumbling them this way and that; and, as he
charged down upon them, whirling the mysterious
<i>mere</i> over his head, the executioners dropped the
rope and fled for their lives, howling.
</p>

<p>
In an instant George was at his friend, plucked the
cruel rope from his neck, and flung it away.  Then
pushing Terence behind him against the tree, he
stood on the defensive, eyes glaring, but keen; his
chest heaving from his run; challenge and menace
in every line of him.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap10"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER X
<br /><br />
TOGETHER AGAIN
</h3>

<p>
When the Maoris recovered from the shock of his
rush, they faced George as he stood covering his
friend's body with his own.  There was no noise, no
shouting; but the stern Roman faces looked very
grim and determined.  Then Winata Pakaro with
oily tongue began an argument, in the midst of
which was heard the click of the hammer of a gun
drawn back to full cock.
</p>

<p>
But while Winata's smooth periods flowed on,
there was a sudden rush, a scuffle, a shout of wrathful
surprise, and there was George back again under
the tree with the rifle in his hand.  He had wrested
it from the astonished warrior who had so stealthily&mdash;as
he imagined&mdash;made ready to use it.
</p>

<p>
In another moment Terence's wrists and ankles
were free and the rifle in his grasp, while George
once more flourished his famous club, rightly judging
that its moral effect would be considerable, while as to
its physical possibilities there was no doubt whatever.
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-106"></a>
<br />
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-106.jpg" alt="in another moment Terence's wrists were free, and the rifle in his grasp (page 106)." />
<br />
In another moment Terence's wrists were free, <br />
and the rifle in his grasp (page 106).
</p>

<p>
These things done in the space of a second or two,
George began to harangue the Maoris, but Winata
Pakaro cut into his first words with:
</p>

<p>
'Stand aside, Hortoni!  We wish not to injure
you; but this man must die.'
</p>

<p>
'Stand you back, O Winata Pakaro!' retorted
George.  'This man is my brother in all but blood,
and I say that he shall not die.'
</p>

<p>
There was a roar of incredulous laughter at what
the chiefs took to be an expedient lie, and Winata
muttered a hasty order over his shoulder.
</p>

<p>
'Look out!' cried George, suspecting his design.
'Fire as he jumps.'
</p>

<p>
But a long whistle shrilled from Winata's lips, and
he flung himself flat on the ground as the Maoris
made an ugly rush forward and Terence's rifle spoke.
</p>

<p>
Fortunately for the friends, the bullet merely
startled an elderly chief into a most undignified
caper as it hummed past his ear, and on the instant
Winata leaped from the ground and hurled himself
at Terence.
</p>

<p>
But the great fighter was handicapped by his fear
of George, whose own weapon came more than once
so dangerously near his head that he gave back in
alarm; for there was no knowing when that magical
piece of greenstone would spring out of its master's
hand and begin a devil's dance upon its own account.
</p>

<p>
Still, it might have gone hardly with Terence, but
that, as the Maoris surged about him, a deep voice
cried angrily: 'Is the word of Te Karearea of no
weight in this <i>hapu</i>?  And you, Hortoni, why do you
break faith with me?'
</p>

<p>
Where the chief had sprung from George had no
idea, but he was uncommonly glad to see him, and, as
the Maoris shrank back, he briefly explained who
Terence was and what had taken place.  Thereupon
Te Karearea turned upon Winata Pakaro and rated
him viciously, demanding how he had dared to take
so much upon himself.  To this verbal castigation
Winata merely opposed a smile of cynical
amusement as he walked away.
</p>

<p>
Then Te Karearea faced George once more and
said graciously, 'I give you, O Hortoni, the life of the
friend for whom you would have given your own.
To-morrow you shall tell me the story of your
friendship.  But he must give up the rifle.'
</p>

<p>
At a nod from George, Terence surrendered the
rifle, and Te Karearea then extended his hand, as if
expecting to receive the greenstone club as well.
But when this piece of impudent bluff&mdash;which was
extremely well acted&mdash;met with the reception it
deserved, he grinned good-humouredly and nodded
to the pair to withdraw, which they did at once.
</p>

<p>
With his arm round Terence's shoulders, George
piloted his chum towards the huge fallen tree,
beneath which he designed to pass the night.  'You
dear old fellow!' he said heartily, drawing Terence
to him.  'Who would have thought of meeting
here, and like this?  What a mercy I came up in
time!'
</p>

<p>
'Thank God you did!' replied Terence, unable to
repress a shudder; for when a brave man has stared
death in the face, and the grim Gatherer has passed
on, leaving him untouched, he is not, as a rule,
flippant about his experience.
</p>

<p>
'When I came rushing up, I hadn't the faintest
idea that I was to meet you,' went on George.
'Indeed, I only recognised you when you screamed
at me in that queer, cracked voice.  In the first
place, I had never seen you in uniform, and in
the&mdash;&mdash;  Hold up, old fellow!'
</p>

<p>
For Terence staggered and would have fallen, had
not the strong arm around his shoulders slipped to
his waist and supported him.
</p>

<p>
George laid him down and bent anxiously over
him, seeing that he had fainted.  The strain had
been dreadful, and, brave though he was, his
emotional nature had lent an added poignancy to the
sufferings of that terrible half-hour.
</p>

<p>
In a few minutes he revived, and looking up at his
friend with an apologetic smile, murmured: 'I'm all
right now.  I did not mean&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Lie still and don't talk, dear old fellow,'
interrupted George; but Terence sat up with his back
against the tree and drank a cup of water which
George handed him.  Then George, wishful to take
his thoughts off his recent peril, began to chat about
the sharpshooter of the early morning.
</p>

<p>
'What became of that crack shot of yours?' he
inquired.  'He was wonderful.  The Maoris lost two
men, and I myself came within an ace of adding
another bull's-eye to his score.'
</p>

<p>
At this Terence gasped in a queer way and
collapsed flat upon his face; but when George, who
thought that he had fainted again, was about to rise,
he scrambled to his knees, and catching his friend in
a bear's hug, exclaimed brokenly: 'Oh, thank God!
O George, thank God I didn't hit you!  Oh!'
</p>

<p>
He buried his face in his arms, while George patted
his broad back, saying soothingly: 'So it was you
after all!  Curiously enough, I thought so at the
time; but I did not see how such a thing could be.
Cheer up, old fellow!  There's no harm done.'
</p>

<p>
Terence wrung his friend's hand.  There were
traces of tears upon his cheeks, but he did not seem
to mind.  'I took deliberate aim at you,' he said.
'We all thought that the white man on the hill must
be one of those Pakeha-Maori rascals; so I let drive
and&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Missed him!  So that's all right,' finished George
cheerfully.  'You must not let out to these people
that you were the slayer of their comrades, or we
shall hear a lot about a blood-feud and have endless
trouble.  By the way, was Te Karearea present at
your court-martial?'
</p>

<p>
'I saw nothing of him until he stopped our little
fight.  Why?'
</p>

<p>
George did not explain.  He had reason to know
that the chief did not always choose to appear as the
moving spirit in the programme of events.  'No
matter,' he said.  'Now, I want to hear all your
news.  Are you hungry?'
</p>

<p>
'Oh no; your friends fed me well before turning
me over to the hangman.'
</p>

<p>
'Don't call them my friends,' protested George.
'I would&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Oh!  Then you are not a Pakeha-Maori?' put in
Terence, with an air of great simplicity.
</p>

<p>
'You are yourself again, I see,' said George,
laughing.  'Fill your pipe and let me hear your
adventures.'
</p>

<p>
'I have had none until to-day,' began Terence.
'Colonel Cranstoun was very kind to me on board;
but he and Horn kept me at it with never-ending
drill.  By the way, the colonel expressed his regret
that he had packed you off in the tug.'
</p>

<p>
'No!  Surely not?' George grinned.
</p>

<p>
'Yes.  He pulled his long moustache, and observed:
"I should have done better to keep the young
scapegrace under my own eye."'
</p>

<p>
'You humbug!' laughed George.  'Go on.'
</p>

<p>
'He is a fine old fellow, George.  On the third day
out we met a Sydney-bound brig, which hove to, and
the colonel sent a letter to your father.  You saw it,
no doubt.'
</p>

<p>
'No; but I am glad he wrote it.  I started on your
trail next morning.'
</p>

<p>
'What a fellow you are!' said Terence admiringly.
'I was sure that you would lose no time.  But next
morning!'
</p>

<p>
'Get on with your yarn,' ordered George.
</p>

<p>
'Right, sir!  In due time we arrived at Auckland,
where Colonel Cranstoun took me out of the ranks
and made me useful as an orderly, or something
of the kind.  Since then I have been sent here, there,
and everywhere.  My last mission was to bring
dispatches from our colonel in Wanganui to Major
Biggs at Poverty Bay.  There I found Biggs just
starting after your beauties, so I got permission to
join the expedition.'
</p>

<p>
'How did he hear of our arrival?' put in George.
</p>

<p>
'I can't say; and it is still a mystery to me how you
come to be with these fellows at all.  I am burning
to hear your story.  However, I will finish mine first.
We have followed your trail for four days, and
to-day, as you know, the fight began.  I was sent back
to Turanga for reinforcements; but as I heard on
the way that Biggs was somewhere else, hurrying
up the commissariat, I rode hither again.  Of course
I had not the least idea that the camp had meantime
changed hands.  That's my history, and a dull one it
is.  Now for yours.'
</p>

<p>
He listened, absorbed, to the recital of his chum's
adventures.  'I do envy you,' he said, as George
wound up his narrative.  'You certainly have not
lacked incident.  Let me see this wonderful&mdash;<i>mere</i>,
do you call it?'
</p>

<p>
George handed over the club, which Terence
examined with deep interest.
</p>

<p>
'It seems to me,' he said at last, 'that you will do
well to take that old man's advice and hold fast to
this club; for&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, nonsense!' interjected George.  'How can
there be any magic inherent in a piece of greenstone?
The curious things which have occurred in connection
with it are not inexplicable.'
</p>

<p>
'Explain, then, its return after your own eyes had
seen it falling into the sea.'
</p>

<p>
'There must be an explanation,' said George doggedly.
</p>

<p>
'Say, rather, that, like all your unimaginative race,
you refuse to believe in anything you cannot
understand.  If there is nothing exceptional about the
club, why is Te Karearea so anxious to get it?'
</p>

<p>
'It is, of course, surrounded with traditions,' began
George, and suddenly sprang up and darted round
the tree in time to see a dark figure bounding away
into the bush.  Pursuit was useless, so George
returned to their fire, expressing his conviction that
the eavesdropper had been Te Karearea.
</p>

<p>
'As I said, he attaches importance to the club, if
you don't,' was Terence's comment.
</p>

<p>
'More likely he came here to learn what he could
about you,' George argued; 'for I don't believe in his
protestation of ignorance of English.'
</p>

<p>
'All the same, you follow the old man's advice,
and never let that club be far from you,' urged
Terence.
</p>

<p>
'Well, it is a singular fact that the moment of my
greatest peril was just after I had been deprived of
the <i>mere</i>,' admitted George.
</p>

<p>
'Yet even that peril was averted.'
</p>

<p>
'Yes; and I do not understand why.  From the
moment of our meeting, Te Karearea has treated
me with great consideration, and&mdash;though it may
sound absurd&mdash;has sometimes seemed afraid of me.
Not, of course, in a physical sense.  There is
something incomprehensible at work.'
</p>

<p>
'Perhaps he still hopes to convert you to his views.'
</p>

<p>
'He need not on that account fear me.'
</p>

<p>
'True.  The great thing is the plain fact that
association with the club has saved your life so far.
I think&mdash;&mdash;'  He yawned widely.
</p>

<p>
'I think that you are more than half asleep,'
finished George.  'Your bed is there, under the tree,
and here is a blanket for you.'
</p>

<p>
Terence threw himself down at once, but almost
immediately sprang up again.  'Give me your hand,
George,' he said.
</p>

<p>
'What's the matter now?' asked George, obeying.
</p>

<p>
'Brute that I am, I have never even thanked you.
But you know, old fellow&mdash;my dear old chum, you
know&mdash;&mdash;'  He paused, blinking hard.
</p>

<p>
'I should think I did!' cried George, capering with
the pain of that friendly squeeze.  'Brute!  You are
indeed.  A grizzly isn't in it with you.  Away with
you to bed, and don't talk any more nonsense.'
</p>

<p>
'I won't,' said Terence seriously; 'but I will do at
last what I ought to have done at first.'  Without a
word more he dropped upon his knees and buried
his face in his hands.  A few minutes later he rose
quietly, and with a nod at George, lay down upon his
fern-bed and prepared to sleep.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap11"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XI
<br /><br />
ONE MYSTERY THE LESS
</h3>

<p>
'The <i>réveillé</i>!' laughed Terence, as he awoke next
morning to the cheerful notes of a bugle.  'For a
moment I thought that I was back with the old
regiment.'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, the soldier fashion in which we do things here
would not disgrace the "old regiment," as you call it,'
said George, smiling.  'Your own red coat, by the
way, has a suspicious newness about it.  Did you
sleep well?'
</p>

<p>
'Never better.  Ah, George, old fellow, I owe&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Here's breakfast,' broke in George hastily, giving
him a mighty smack on the back, to the great delight
of Kawainga, Star of the Dawn, who appeared with
two satellites, bearing the materials for a substantial
breakfast.
</p>

<p>
Soon they were again upon the march, and Te
Karearea, who had taken every precaution against
a surprise, jogged peacefully along, smoking a looted
cigar, and listening with interest to the story of the
youthful adventures of George and Terence, whom
he addressed as Mura, or The Blazing One.  The name
had much the sound of Moore, but it was the appearance
of the Irishman, with his red coat and flaming
head of hair, which had really suggested the title.
</p>

<p>
'It is good to hear of such friendship,' the chief
said, beaming upon the pair during a pause in their
narration.  'Surely Mura will not wish to leave us
now that he has found you, Hortoni.  Persuade him
to stay, my friend.'
</p>

<p>
George looked him in the eyes and laughed quietly.
He translated to Terence, but made no reply to the
chief, who did not pursue the subject.
</p>

<p>
'What did he mean by that remark, George?'
inquired Terence as they lay in the shade during the
midday halt.
</p>

<p>
'I can't say exactly, for one never knows what the
crafty beggar is up to.'  He looked cautiously round,
but as no one was near, went on: 'He may even wish
you to try and escape, in order to&mdash;to&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'To find an excuse for knocking me on the head,'
supplied Terence.  'Then he'll  be disappointed, for
I'll not leave you&mdash;unless escape meant a good chance
of helping you out of the trap.  In that case I'd go
this minute.'
</p>

<p>
'I am sure you would, dear old fellow!' said George
affectionately; 'but we will stick together as long as
possible.  Only, if the chief does not parole you,
then&mdash;&mdash;'  He broke off short, staring up at Te
Karearea, who had, as usual, approached unobserved.
</p>

<p>
'It looks as if the rascal possesses the power
to render himself invisible at will,' said George
disgustedly, when the chief had withdrawn after
informing them that the march was about to be
resumed.  'We shall have to go warily, Terence; for
there is no knowing how much he may have heard.'
</p>

<p>
'Much good may it do him,' remarked Terence
airily.  'And if it comes to knocking on the head&mdash;&mdash;'  He
bent his arm.  The great biceps contracted, bulging
out the red sleeve.  Let that enormous mass of
muscle be extended with the weight of the body
behind it, and the fist in front of it would surely
trouble somebody's weak nerves.
</p>

<p>
George smiled.  'Oh, I know what you can do;
but a couple of hundred to one is long odds.
Meantime, you must not run the risk of offending him;
for, remember, he is utterly unscrupulous.  In some
mysterious way I appear to be necessary to him; but
were it otherwise, he would kill me without the
slightest compunction.  Of that I feel sure.  Come! it
is time we joined him.'
</p>

<p>
Four days later, towards sunset, they debouched
from the forest through which for the last sixty
hours they had toiled wearily along a narrow, difficult
track.  It had been a terrible journey for the Maoris,
but far more so for the white men, and all alike
rejoiced when at last the dreadful bush lay behind
them, and they beheld the river which alone divided
them from the <i>pah</i> which was their goal.
</p>

<p>
As was usual with the Maori fortresses, the position
was one of immense strength.  The island plain, at
the back of which rose a considerable hill, was a
swampy area overgrown with flax, and extended for
nearly a mile on every side of the eminence but one,
being itself enclosed by a forked ravine, at the bottom
of which the river roared and swirled among giant
boulders.  No doubt, at some far-off day this roughly
level plain had itself been covered with forest; but
dead and gone generations of Maoris had cleared
away the offending wood, so that no one could now
approach the <i>pah</i> unobserved.  The single side of the
hill unflanked by the plain was simply a vast,
precipitous rock-face, having for its <i>vis-à-vis</i> the equally
precipitous opposing wall of the ravine, into whose
depths it dropped a sheer two hundred feet, the twin
cliffs forming a cañon through which the river raced
on its way to unite again with the main stream.
</p>

<p>
The place was, indeed, almost inaccessible when
once the only approach from the forest was barred.
This was merely a rough bridge across the river on
the side furthest from the hill, and when the
tree-trunks forming this were withdrawn, a handful of
men could easily hold the island against an army.
</p>

<p>
But even were the bridge to be rushed, the ascent
of the hill was made difficult by carefully laid trenches
and rifle-pits, and, finally, the <i>pah</i> was encircled by a
double row of palisades of great height and immense
strength, the chinks between the massive logs being
filled with hard-baked mud and clay.  The palisades
were loopholed above, and a rude platform ran along
the inner side of each row, where men might lie,
secure themselves, and fire upon an advancing foe.
</p>

<p>
It would indeed be a desperate and determined foe
who would venture to attack, much more succeed in
taking, the <i>Pah O Te Mate</i>&mdash;the Pah of the Slain,
the Fortress of Death.
</p>

<p>
As it happened, the weary travellers were not
destined to enter the <i>pah</i> just yet; for as the
vanguard swung out of the forest and prepared to cross
the hundred yards or so of cleared ground between
them and the bridge, they saw a sight which halted
them as effectually as though some sudden stroke
had robbed their limbs of all power.
</p>

<p>
But they could not stand still, for those in the rear
pressed them on, and presently the little clearing
became almost blocked with armed men vainly striving
to preserve their customary proud and resolute
bearing, and with trembling women who did not
attempt to hide their extreme terror.
</p>

<p>
In the midst of the confusion the voice of Te
Karearea was heard angrily demanding the cause of
the block, but no sooner had the chief forced his way
to the front than he, too, stopped as if compelled, all
signs of anger faded from his face, and he stood meek
and inoffensive, his hands crossed upon his broad
chest, his plumed head bowed low.
</p>

<p>
And what was the cause of all this fear and
commotion?  Standing alone at the bridge-head was one
old man.  His figure was bent, his snow-white hair
fell, a tangle of locks, below his shoulders, and the
hand which grasped the staff upon which he leaned,
trembled as it clutched the crook.  Yet there was fire
in his rolling eyes, and a hint of mastery, if not of
menace, in the gesture with which he flung up his
free hand, forbidding the advance; and his voice, far
from piping in the thin treble of extreme old age,
rang stern and sonorous, as the liquid Maori speech
gushed from his venerable lips.
</p>

<p>
He was Kapua Mangu&mdash;the Black Cloud&mdash;the
<i>Tohunga</i>, and most notable of all the Maori wizards.
</p>

<p>
At the old man's bidding, Te Karearea advanced
and listened respectfully to some words spoken for
his ear alone.  Then, turning, he rapidly issued an
order which sent the warriors tumbling back into
the forest, while side by side with the great magician,
the chief set off across the plain in the direction
of the <i>pah</i>.
</p>

<p>
'So we are not to enter the fortress to-night,'
George explained to Terence as they followed the
Maoris.  'According to the old gentleman, a
particularly malignant demon has taken up his quarters
on the hill, and any attempt to pass him would be
fraught with dire peril.  To-morrow we are to make
a kind of state entry.'
</p>

<p>
'Which means that the ancient rogue has reasons
for keeping us off the hill to-night.'
</p>

<p>
'Very likely; but it won't hurt us, fortunately.
What do you say to supper and early bed?'
</p>

<p>
'I'm with you there,' agreed Terence, 'for I'm dog
tired.'
</p>

<p>
So they hunted about until they found pretty Miss
Kawainga, who soon provided them with an excellent
meal, after which they selected a comfortable spot
for their bivouac, spread their blankets on the fern,
and were quickly asleep.
</p>

<p>
An hour before midnight something awakened
George, and he sat up and looked in all directions
for the cause.  Everything was profoundly still, and
presently he made out that the camp was deserted,
not a single Maori being visible anywhere.  Wondering
sleepily what the chief was about, he noticed that
their fire had dwindled a good deal, and, knowing that
the early hours of morning would be cold, crept out
of his blanket-bag and rose, yawning, to replenish it.
Hither and thither he moved, gathering sticks
and fern, when suddenly the wood dropped through
his hands, he turned cold, and his heart throbbed
heavily under his creeping flesh.  He drew in a deep
breath, and his strong will and high courage fought
desperately against the unnerving sensations of the
moment.  For once again the quiet night was rent
by those weird, awful sounds which had so unmanned
him during that dreary midnight hour aboard the
brig a week ago.
</p>

<p>
'<i>Hau-hau!  Hau-hau!  Pai marire, hau-hau!
Hau-hau!</i>'
</p>

<p>
From afar the horrid noises screamed through
the shivering forest, mixed now and again with a
singular gabble of words which somehow had the
sound of English, though the distance made it
difficult to judge.
</p>

<p>
George made a fierce effort to collect himself.
Terence had suffered enough already, and for his
sake he must not give way.  But to his intense
surprise he saw the object of his concern sitting up
and listening with an expression of deep interest
on his face.
</p>

<p>
'Queer row, isn't it?' said Terence.  'Do you see
those lights on the hill behind there?  That is
where they are.  Perhaps this explains the
mysterious confab between the chief and the wizard.
I vote we go and have a look at them; we may never
get another chance.'
</p>

<p>
George could scarcely believe his ears.  The noise
which now, as before, so shocked him, was accepted
by Terence as something merely interesting.  Still,
the sight of his friend's unconcern did much to steady
his own jumping nerves.
</p>

<p>
Receiving no answer, Terence looked up.  The
dying fire added to the ghastliness of George's face.
'Hullo!  What is it, old fellow?' he cried, rolling out
of his bag.  'Are you ill?'
</p>

<p>
'I plead guilty to a bad fit of the horrors,' answered
George, 'though your coolness is rapidly convincing
me that my bogy is not so awful as I imagined it to
be.  I never was so frightened in my life as when I
first heard those terrible sounds at dead of night
aboard the brig.  I did not speak of it to you when
we met, because it had nothing to do with my story.
If you know what the noise means, for heaven's sake
tell me at once.'
</p>

<p>
'I thought you knew all about it,' replied Terence.
'The row is horrid, but simple enough in its origin.
It is a part of the religious service, or incantation,
perhaps I should say, of the Hau-haus.'
</p>

<p>
'Oh!  And who may the Hau-haus be?  Men or devils?'
</p>

<p>
'Men, distinctly; but with a strong dash of the devil
in them, too.'
</p>

<p>
'Are they Maoris?'
</p>

<p>
'Very much so.  The same among whom you have
been adventuring this month past.  Let us steal back
to that hill and lay your ghost for once and all.  I'll
tell you what I know as we go.'
</p>

<p>
'I'm with you,' agreed George.  'I'm thankful to
have fathomed this uncanny mystery.  Hark!  They
are at it again.'  Once more the unholy clamour
swelled upon the quiet air.
</p>

<p>
Even the sentinels had left the camp and gone,
presumably, to the hill, where, as they advanced, the
friends could see great fires blazing and vomiting
clouds of smoke into the blackness of the night.  As
they went, Terence discoursed in low tones of the
rise and progress of the Hau-hau religion, and its
effect upon those Maoris who had embraced it.
</p>

<p>
'I learned what I have told you from a friendly
Arawa chief,' he said, as they drew near the ravine
which formed the approach to the hill.  'He spun
the yarn one night around the camp-fire, and by way
of illustration gathered a few of his men and
surprised us a little later with a very creditable
imitation of the howling which so disturbed you.  I must
own that, until I knew what it was, I felt far from
comfortable.'
</p>

<p>
'I don't blame you,' said George with a shudder.
'And there have been many converts to Hau-hauism,
you say.'
</p>

<p>
'Plenty; and to-day the Hau-haus are the fiercest
and most implacable of our foes.  They have some
very unpleasant customs, and that nasty yowling,
with its blasphemous invocation of the Holy Trinity,
is not the least atrocious of them.'
</p>

<p>
Their cautious march ceased now, and they began
to crawl quietly up the side of the ravine, from the
plateau above which came the hum of many voices.
</p>

<p>
'Te Karearea must have joined this sect before he
was packed off to Chatham Island,' said George.  'I
remember that he said something one day about
being a priest among his own people.'
</p>

<p>
'Hush!' warned Terence.  'I hear them moving
just above us.'
</p>

<p>
They flattened themselves against the side of the
ravine and waited their opportunity.  Suddenly a
succession of yells burst from three hundred lusty
throats, and the ground shook to the trampling of
the mob as they hurled themselves this way and that
in their fierce ecstasy.
</p>

<p>
'Now is our chance,' whispered Terence, and under
cover of the tumult they dragged themselves up the
bank and lay flat among the fern at the top.
</p>

<p>
What a sight met their astonished eyes!
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XII
<br /><br />
VANISHED
</h3>

<p>
From where the friends lay they looked across a
rude plateau, dotted with ti-tree, koromiko, and other
bushes, and upon this, at intervals of a dozen yards,
three huge fires blazed and roared and crackled under
frequent additions of fuel.  The ground swarmed
with Maoris, many of whom Te Karearea had
recruited on his march, and most of them were naked,
save for their <i>katikas</i>, or short kilts of flax.  As their
bodies were splashed and streaked with red and
white paint, it required but little imagination to
conceive them an array of petticoated skeletons,
gouted with blood, dancing round the wild fires of a
witches' sabbath.
</p>

<p>
Between two of the fires there had been set up a
long pole, upon whose spiked summit, pitiful to see,
was a human head, wonderfully preserved after the
Maori fashion.  It was the head of a white man, too,
as was plainly shown by the fair hair and whiskers
which still covered the dried, stretched skin of scalp
and cheeks.
</p>

<p>
'All that is left of poor Lloyd,' whispered Terence.
'Te Karearea must have sent for it.  Look, here he
comes with Winata Pakaro and another.  Where is
the old wizard?'
</p>

<p>
With stately tread the three chiefs approached,
the Maoris forming in two long lines on opposite
sides of the great fires, while every eye was bent
upon the dignified figure of their commander.
</p>

<p>
For some moments Te Karearea stood still, gazing
up at the impaled head.  Then suddenly he began to
dance.  Slowly he moved at first; but with each
succeeding minute his steps grew quicker, his gestures
more frantic, his gyrations more wild.  Round and
round, up and down, from side to side he sprang and
whirled and bounded, until it seemed a marvel how
he kept his balance.  All at once, after a figure of
extraordinary swiftness and duration, he stopped.
</p>

<p>
With arms outstretched and head thrown back, so
that his eyes stared up at that poor head upon the
pole, he stood an instant, and then from his open
mouth there issued a piercing voice, which screamed
and gabbled the most appalling mixture of frenzied
prayer and blasphemous incantation.
</p>

<p>
And the voice which possessed Te Karearea was
so unlike his own, so compact of yell and howl and
bark and screech and frenzied raving, that George,
shuddering where he lay, muttered to Terence: 'This
man hath a devil.'
</p>

<p>
The awful voice ceased, and Te Karearea, falling
headlong, writhed in a convulsion.  As if at a signal,
the whole crowd, men and women, broke ranks and
rushed to form a circle round the <i>niu</i>, or sacred
pole.
</p>

<p>
And then began a dance indeed.  No one there but
was <i>pourewarewa</i>&mdash;half-mad&mdash;with religious ecstasy,
and wholly consumed with hatred of the detested
Pakeha.  So round and round they circled, hands
joined, at an ever increasing speed, till the lighter of
them, dragged off their feet by their stronger, swifter
comrades, seemed to fly like witches and warlocks
through the air.
</p>

<p>
And all the time the infernal din went on&mdash;the
barking scream of Hau-hau!  Hau-hau! the blasphemous
invocation, the senseless jumble of word
and phrase.
</p>

<p>
It was a revolting scene, but so wildly exciting,
that the watchers forgot their fatigue and, more,
the danger they ran from discovery.
</p>

<p>
Slowly the mad orgies came to an end, and as one
by one the dancers gave way under the tremendous
physical and mental strain, they fell to the ground.
And where they fell they lay, to be pounded and
bruised under the naked feet of those who still leapt
and whirled around the pole.
</p>

<p>
'We had better make off,' whispered George,' for,
if they find us here, we shall neither of us see
to-morrow.'
</p>

<p>
'Right!'  With the word Terence half-turned to
begin the descent.  But at that very moment he
became aware of an ominous sound, unheard before
in the hideous din&mdash;the soft pad-pad of scores of
naked feet, running swiftly through the forest.
</p>

<p>
In a flash George grabbed him by the wrist.  'Lie
close!  We are cut off.  A number of them are
coming up the hill.'
</p>

<p>
Still as mice they lay, while the noise of the onrush
grew louder, and at last Te Karearea, raising himself
wearily, shouted hoarsely, 'Awake, fools!  Awake,
and stand to your arms, unless ye desire to be slain
as ye lie.  Ha!  Awake!'
</p>

<p>
Instantly a deep voice shouted from the ravine,
'All is well, O Far-darting Hawk!  We come from
afar to do thy will.  Forward, brothers, to salute
your chief!'
</p>

<p>
A loud yell responded to this exhortation, and the
men coming up the hillside charged forward at a
tremendous rate, while George and Terence, feeling
that now, indeed, their lives were the sport of fate,
threw themselves flat upon the ground and awaited
the issue.
</p>

<p>
George's belt had worked round, so that his greenstone
club was in front, the hard handle pressing
painfully against his breast-bone.  As he had no time
to adjust the belt, he cautiously raised himself on his
hands and knees, drew out the weapon, and laid it
among the fern in front of him.  Before he could
sink to earth again, the vanguard of the new
company crashed up the side of the ravine and broke, a
wildly-rushing wave, on all sides of him.
</p>

<p>
Not daring to move, he held perfectly still, while
the reinforcements poured by, the tramp and clatter
of their bare feet upon dead wood and fern sounding
a jarring undernote to their yell and song.  The
hindmost of them passed swiftly, avoiding almost
miraculously the crouching figures in the fern, and
George and Terence, half-suffocated, breathed again.
</p>

<p>
'Safe!' muttered George, hallooing, like many
another, before he was out of the wood; for, ere
he could move, two more Maoris, the whippers-in,
perhaps, came racing up.  The first sprang clear
over Terence, who still lay flat, but the second was
neatly 'rabbited' over George's broad, arched back
and sent flying upon his face a dozen feet ahead.
</p>

<p>
In an instant the Maori was up and back with a
panther-like bound at the spot at which the accident
had occurred.  He knew that his fall had been caused
by a man, and his fears, actively working, assured
him that the man must be an enemy.
</p>

<p>
With a loud, snorting 'Ha!' the Maori brought
down his heavy wooden club with deadly accuracy
of aim, and Terence, who had scrambled up, involuntarily
closed his eyes, and would fain have closed
his ears, too.  But instead of the dull scrunch which
his quivering nerves were expecting, he heard a
sharp, rattling smack, an exclamation of wild
surprise, and, as he looked again, saw the wooden <i>mere</i>
sailing through the air, to be caught, as it descended,
by the outstretched hand of the active Maori.
</p>

<p>
For a moment Terence was stupefied, and then
enlightenment came.  The greenstone club, which
George had held in his upraised hands, had once
more come between him and death, intercepting the
murderous blow, and disarming his assailant.
</p>

<p>
The Maori still held George at a disadvantage, but
made no effort to follow up his attack.  Bending
down until his lips were close to the Englishman's
ear, he muttered in agitated tones, 'Hortoni!  Master!
Forgive!  I knew thee not, and have brought danger
upon thee.  Fly swiftly.  I will hold them back.'
</p>

<p>
The case was not one for argument, and as George
and Terence raced down the hill, Paeroa&mdash;for it was
indeed he&mdash;sprang out of the bushes with a yell and
bounded after his comrade.
</p>

<p>
The latter, of course, had heard the commotion, and
was coming back to inquire into its cause; but Paeroa
met him with the frightful announcement, 'It was a
lizard!  A <i>taipo</i>!  I have slain him.'  Then screeching
'<i>Taipo!  Taipo!</i>' at the top of his voice, he sped
towards Te Karearea, closely followed by his friend,
who had no desire to investigate further.  For the
mere mention of a lizard is horrible to a Maori, so
ingrained is the superstition that evil spirits of most
malignant type invariably assume this shape.
</p>

<p>
But Paeroa had reckoned without his over-lord.
Te Karearea was by no means free from superstition,
but he was a man of keen intelligence, and he instantly
perceived that Paeroa's story did not square with the
noise of fast-retreating footsteps.  So he rapidly
issued orders which sent a score of the newly-arrived
Maoris hastening upon the track of the fugitives,
while Paeroa, who attempted to lead them with a
view of helping the Pakehas, was sternly ordered to
remain where he was.
</p>

<p>
The Maoris, uncertain whether they were chasing
men or demons, made a lusty noise to scare the latter
and keep up their own courage, and with the roar
of the pursuit thundering in their ears, George and
Terence dashed down the hill at what was very nearly
breakneck speed.  For a fall among the boulders or
a headlong crash against the trunk of a tree might
easily serve to smash a skull or snap a spinal column.
</p>

<p>
But, fortunately for them, the nature of the
ground soon became such as no man could pass
through at a run.
</p>

<p>
Had they struck the rough path which Te Karearea's
axe-men had hewn while they slept, or chanced on
one of the numerous tracks which pierced the forest
for miles around for the convenience of hunters, all
would have been well; for all these roads led to the
river or to the bivouac.  Once there, ahead of the
Hau-haus, they might have defied detection, since no
one but Paeroa could certainly have said who were
the intruders upon their grim rites.
</p>

<p>
But in the first mad rush of their flight they had
plunged deeply into the maze of the forest, where,
dark as it was, for the half-moon was low, they were
almost at the mercy of the thorns, which rent their
clothes and tore their bodies, and of the thousand-armed,
clinging <i>kawakawa</i>, the supplejack, whose
tough, all-embracing tendrils held them back with
the power of ropes.
</p>

<p>
'We are trapped,' panted Terence.  'Let us turn
and make a fight of it.'
</p>

<p>
For behind, alongside, and even ahead of them
pealed the vengeful shouts of the Hau-haus.
</p>

<p>
'Range up alongside me,' George answered over
his shoulder.  'I have a better plan than that.'  His
temper seemed to cool and his brain to grow clearer
the greater the emergency.
</p>

<p>
'All right!  Wait until I catch up to you,' said
Terence.  'Then I will&mdash;Ah-h-h&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
Before he could finish what he was about to say,
there broke from him that strange, solitary note of
alarm, sharp at first, then long drawn and dying
away in a curiously muffled shriek.  Then silence,
save for the occasional yell of a pursuer, and a faint
rustling near by, as of branches coming gradually to
rest after a puff of wind.  But there was no wind.
</p>

<p>
'Terence!' George called softly.  'Terence!  Where
are you?'  But he got no answer, and, full of terror,
began to grope his way to the spot whence his
comrade's voice had seemed to come.
</p>

<p>
'Terence!' he called again loudly, careless of his
own safety, if only he might bring help to his friend.
'Terence!  Speak to me.  Oh, what has happened?
Where can he be?  There was no sound of a blow
or&mdash;Ah-h-h&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
Just as with Terence, that one sharp, quavering
cry&mdash;and then George's voice, too, died away, and a
terrible silence fell upon the dark bush.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap13"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XIII
<br /><br />
DOWN AMONG THE DEAD MEN
</h3>

<p>
Crash!  George's heavy body broke through the
tangle upon which he had stepped, and down he
went through impenetrable darkness to the bottom
of the hole into which he had fallen.
</p>

<p>
Breathless and bruised he picked himself up,
relieved to find his bones unbroken.  The mystery
was dispelled now, for Terence must have preceded
him; but a spasm of fear gripped his heart as his
foot struck against the body of his friend.
</p>

<p>
'Is that you, George?  What a good fellow you
are.  I thought you wouldn't be long after me,' came
from the ground, and in the fullness of his relief
George laughed out.
</p>

<p>
'What a joker it is!' he said.  'One would have
thought that a fall like this would have taken the
sprightliness out of you, Terence.'
</p>

<p>
'I fell on my head,' the Irishman answered simply,
'and that, no doubt, saved my life.  Strike a match
and let us see where we are.'  Then, as George
obeyed, 'Why, you are covered with blood.  Are you
hurt, dear old fellow?'
</p>

<p>
'I fell upon my nose,' replied George dryly, 'and,
as it is not so hard as your head, you see the result.
But, thank God, we are no worse.  We seem to be
in a kind of tunnel.  If the Maoris know of the
place&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'We shall be in a hole, indeed,' put in the
irrepressible Terence.
</p>

<p>
But it was no tunnel into which they had fallen,
but a vast, underground forest&mdash;a wonder of God's
own working.  Here and there in New Zealand these
dead worlds exist, in which, when once you have
found your way thither, you must believe yourself
to be within the veritable home of the gnomes and
elementals.  The tops of dead trees, fixed in the
earth above and cemented by the decay of ages, form
the roof of your new world, while their great trunks,
not so much decayed as changed by mineral deposit,
stand like tall sentinels guarding the long gone past,
the very emblems of the grandeur of repose.
</p>

<p>
Such a space as this may extend for miles, or may
show as a comparatively small chamber, owing to
subsidence from above; while from some such hole as
that down which the friends had fallen, or from cracks
in the upper earth, 'a dim, religious light' struggles
through, which faintly illumines, while it does not
dispel, the weird gloom of the subterranean forest.
</p>

<p>
Of course all this did not become clear in a moment
to our adventurers; but one discovery George did
make as he struck his third match, and he raised
something from the ground as it flickered out.
</p>

<p>
'This looks as if the place was known and used,'
he said, endeavouring to ignite the thing he had
picked up.  It was a torch, and a bundle of them lay
at his feet.  For some time he was unsuccessful, but
at last the end caught, and the torch burned with a
feeble light.
</p>

<p>
'These were not made yesterday,' went on George,
lighting another from the one he held and handing it
to Terence.  'Pick up a few and let us explore a bit.'
</p>

<p>
It was soon evident that they could not get out by
the way they had come in, at least, not without the
aid of a rope, and from this, and the condition of
the torches, they argued that the place, though
known at one time, had long ago fallen into disuse.
But Terence was by no means disheartened, and was
eager to go forward.
</p>

<p>
'Come on!' he cried.  'Our way lies in this direction
as far as we know.'
</p>

<p>
'But, if we go forward among the mazes of these
dead trees, we may discover no other outlet and be
unable to find our way back to this one,' argued
George.
</p>

<p>
'Never mind; let us chance it,' insisted Terence.
'There must be another entrance or outlet or these
torches would not be here.'
</p>

<p>
George yielded against his better judgment, and
for half an hour they wandered through what they
now realised to be a dead forest, but no way out did
they find.  Suddenly the Irishman pulled up.
</p>

<p>
'Why, in all this new excitement I had quite
forgotten that marvellous occurrence upon the hill,' he
said.  'Of course I jumped to the conclusion that the
Maori was Paeroa, of whom you told me; but what I
want to know is&mdash;How came you to drag out your
own club and hold it over your head just in time to
guard his stroke?'
</p>

<p>
'My belt had got screwed round and the club was
hurting my chest; so I took it out and laid it on the
fern in front of me when first we "grassed"
ourselves.  But, if you will believe me, I have not the
slightest recollection of picking it up again when I
rolled over on my back as Paeroa struck at me.'
</p>

<p>
'Then you expected to be struck,' said Terence.
</p>

<p>
'I can hardly say.  I know that I was mightily
surprised when my <i>mere</i> broke the shock of the
wooden club, for I did not see it in my hands as I
stared up at Paeroa.'
</p>

<p>
'But you must have felt it,' persisted Terence.
</p>

<p>
'I did not,' returned George with equal earnestness.
'It seems to me that I had no knowledge of it
whatever until Paeroa struck his blow.'
</p>

<p>
Terence rumpled his fiery curls.  'It is all very odd
and uncanny.  How do you account for it?' he
asked.
</p>

<p>
'I can't account for it,' George answered.  'Perhaps
the mystery, if there is one, will explain itself
some day.  Meantime, where are we?'
</p>

<p>
'One thing is certain,' said Terence, ignoring the
change of subject.  'That greenstone club always
seems to be interposed, or to interpose itself, between
you and danger&mdash;if not death&mdash;in the nick of time.
Well, it's no use speculating.  Where are we?  In
goblin-land, I should say.  The very place for them.'
</p>

<p>
They walked on for the best part of an hour and
then found themselves at the bottom of a shallow
gully, in the opposite steep of which gaped a large
rent, which looked as if it might be the mouth of
a cave.
</p>

<p>
The impulsive Terence dashed into the black opening,
followed more sedately by George, and the cave
turned out to be a short tunnel with a sloping floor,
which descended to the level and then quickly sloped
again upwards.  Small rills of water trickled from
the walls or splashed musically upon the floor, where,
as from the roof, stalactites and stalagmites had
formed during the slow march of centuries.
</p>

<p>
'I believe we have passed under the river,' said
George, 'and that tunnel was made by the hand
of man&mdash;though how long ago it is impossible to
guess.  Ah!  Here is a poser.'
</p>

<p>
'Had we not passed through that tunnel, I should
think that we had been walking in a circle all this
time,' remarked Terence, rather hopelessly; for the
scene upon which they issued was the counterpart
of that which they had left behind them on the other
side of the passage.
</p>

<p>
Still they walked on, always ascending now, as it
seemed to them, and at last, just as they came to the
base of a slope, between which and the opposite
ridge a wide, shallow gully extended, Terence halted
suddenly and gripped George's wrist with a warning
'Hush!'
</p>

<p>
He pointed to the left, where a number of Maoris
sat in a circle; but none of them turned round or
took the least notice of the intruders.
</p>

<p>
'Let us go nearer,' whispered Terence.  'You can
speak to them if they seem inclined to be nasty.'
</p>

<p>
But the Maoris who faced them continued to stare
unconcernedly, while the others neither turned their
heads nor made any motion of inquiry towards their
fellows.  They were evidently men of distinction, for
their mats were of the finest workmanship, while the
hair of each, carefully dressed, was adorned with the
coronet of <i>huia</i>[<a id="chap13fn1text"></a><a href="#chap13fn1">1</a>] plumes, the invariable mark of a
chief.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap13fn1"></a>
[<a href="#chap13fn1text">1</a>] <i>Neomorpha Gouldii</i>&mdash;A rare bird.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The two moved quietly forward until they were
within six paces of the silent chiefs, who still neither
moved nor spoke.
</p>

<p>
'Salutations, O friends!' began George.  'Far
be it from us rudely to disturb your meditations;
but&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
He broke off abruptly.  Not a movement, not a
change of expression upon the grim faces.  Silent,
motionless, rigid, the ten chiefs sat, and, suddenly,
the truth flashed upon George.
</p>

<p>
'Terence!' He caught his breath.  'They are all
dead men!'
</p>

<p>
'Dead men?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes.  Where are their eyes?'
</p>

<p>
'Dead men without eyes!'  The emotional Irishman
shuddered, and, scarcely knowing what he was
about, poked his bundle of torches into the back
of the figure nearest to him.  Instantly the uncanny
thing fell over, and at the sight revealed Terence
burst into wild, hysterical laughter.
</p>

<p>
But in an instant George's arm was round his neck,
and George's strong hand was pressed firmly over his
mouth.
</p>

<p>
'Control yourself,' was the stern order.  'These are
dead, but the living may not be far away.'
</p>

<p>
Terence nodded, gasping, and, George having released
him, the two bent over the fallen figure and
pulled aside its mat.  George held up a warning
finger, for Terence again began to giggle at the
extraordinary sight.
</p>

<p>
For the thing had no body!  Not one in all that
silent circle possessed aught but a head, stuck upon a
pointed stick, with a crosspiece for shoulders, upon
which the mat was hung.  In the full glare of day
the illusion would have been impossible; but here, in
the gloom of the underworld, with only the smoke-veiled
light of a couple of torches, it looked real
enough, and horrible enough, too.
</p>

<p>
'We were a pair of jackasses to be taken in,' said
Terence, politely including himself.  'It did not strike
us that they were sitting here in the dark, and that,
but for our torches, we should not have seen them
at all.'
</p>

<p>
George was gazing thoughtfully at the heads.
'You know the established custom,' he said at last.
'When a Maori is killed in battle, or dies away from
home, it is the duty of a friend to cut off his head
and bring it to his relations, so that the family <i>mana</i>,
or honour, may not be sullied.  Then the head is
preserved, and retains, as you see, a weirdly lifelike
appearance.'
</p>

<p>
'I do see,' said Terence, whose lips were twitching.
</p>

<p>
'Now observe,' went on George.  'That is the head
of Te Pouri, whom Te Karearea slew, and next to it
is all that is left of old Te Kaihuia.  Both of these
were brought along by our contingent, so that they
must have been placed here within the last few
hours.  It is reasonable to deduce from this that
there must be an outlet not far away.'
</p>

<p>
'But why have these bodiless heads been set up
here, do you suppose?' inquired Terence.
</p>

<p>
'This may be the storing ground for family relics,
or, perhaps, there may be something peculiarly drying
in the atmosphere.  I really don't know; but&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Hush!  Some one is coming,' in a fierce whisper
from Terence, who instantly extinguished his torch
upon the ground, George following his example.
</p>

<p>
'We must wait, for they will hear us if we run,'
thought George, and then an idea came to him.  He
smiled grimly in the darkness, groping here and
there with his hands.  'Do as I do,' he breathed into
Terence's ear, rapidly whispering directions.
</p>

<p>
'Oh, lord, no; I can't,' sighed Terence.
</p>

<p>
'You must.  We may be dead men else.  Quick!
There is no time to lose.'
</p>

<p>
Voices sounded now, not far away, and dancing
flashes of light began to illumine the near distance.
It was as well that a sharp rise of the ground
intervened between the fugitives and the newcomers;
for, otherwise, the glare from their own torches
would long ago have betrayed the presence of the
former.
</p>

<p>
Presently the light broadened, and, to the surprise
of the watchers, Te Karearea, following the old
<i>tohunga</i>, Kapua Mangu, appeared upon the crest of
the ridge, some twenty paces away from the grim
circle of heads, now once more complete.
</p>

<p>
Te Karearea, who had apparently shaken off the
physical effects of his recent exertion, pulled up short
as Kapua Mangu plunged his hand into a hole in the
trunk of an enormous fallen tree, which formed a
long, low arch across the ridge.  Then, striving to
hide his terror of some supernatural manifestation
under a mask of cultured indifference, the chief
advanced again with the evident intention of looking
over the magician's shoulder.
</p>

<p>
But the old man swung suddenly round and,
crying in a loud, clear voice the single word, '<i>Tapu!</i>'
flung a dark object at the feet of the chief.
</p>

<p>
With a howl of terror Te Karearea reeled away
from the thing upon the ground.  '<i>Ngara!  Tuatara!</i>'
he screeched, and turned to flee from the spot.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap14"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XIV
<br /><br />
MAGIC, BLACK AND WHITE
</h3>

<p>
The gods of the old religion were good enough for
Kapua Mangu, who detested the blasphemous
absurdities of Hau-hauism, and he had brought Te
Karearea, the backslider, to the underground
haunt&mdash;known, he believed, only to himself&mdash;partly to
convince him that the arms of these same old gods
were still powerful, and partly for another reason.
</p>

<p>
Actuated by the first of these motives, he had
produced his very strongest card at the outset of the
interview, and flung at the chief the dried body of a
<i>tuatara</i>, a large and harmless lizard, indigenous to
New Zealand.
</p>

<p>
Yet this was quite enough to overthrow the
nerve of a strong, clever man, and render him
weak and impotent from actual fear.  For in such
terror do the Maoris hold all lizards, that the
mere pronunciation of the word <i>Ngara</i>, a generic
term for the whole race, makes the bravest warrior
tremble.
</p>

<p>
The deep-voiced command of Kapua Mangu arrested
the flight of the chief, and, as if the sight of the
demon on the ground were not sufficient, the old
man, with pointing finger, asked in a terrifying
screech: 'Where, O Hawk of the Mountain, where is
the <i>mere</i> of TUMATAUENGA?'
</p>

<p>
Te Karearea started, but before he could reply,
the venerable mystic flung his arms above his head
and chanted in his fine, sonorous voice the race-old
prophecy of the greenstone club:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'Behold!  In the days to come a strange, strong race<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall contend with the Maori.<br />
  Ah!  Then shall the days be full of evil and danger<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the house of Te Turi.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'And behold!  In those days of unrest and contention<br />
  One of the House of Te Turi shall give to one of the strong,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;strange race<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The <i>mere</i> of TUMATAUENGA.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aue!  Aue!  Alas for the House of Te Turi.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aue!  Aue!  Then shall the doom and the end<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the House of Te Turi be nigh!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'But behold!  If the stranger cleave to the race of the Maori,<br />
  If he give back of his own free will to one of the House of<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Te Turi<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The <i>mere</i> of TUMATAUENGA,<br />
  Then shall the House of Te Turi arise again from the dust.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only thus shall the doom be averted!'<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
'All this thou knewest, O Hawk of the Mountain!
All this I spake in thine ear, O son of the dead and
gone White Mist!' declaimed the old wizard.  'Guile,
not force, must win the <i>mere</i> of TUMATAUENGA from
the Pakeha to whom Te Kaihuia gave it.  Yet, if he
resign the weapon of his own free will, even though
he lay it aside but for a moment, and thou hast the
wit to seize it, then it is thine.'  His voice sank
suddenly to an ordinary tone.  'But doubtless, so
astute a man as Te Karearea, knowing all this, has
already acted upon it.  Say then, O friend,' he
concluded mildly, 'where is the <i>mere</i> of TUMATAUENGA?'
</p>

<p>
Very slowly Te Karearea drew his greenstone
club from his belt and stretched his sinewy arm
across the <i>tapu</i> line.  'It is here,' he faltered, and
almost as the lie dropped from his lips, leaped
backwards with a wild yell of terror.
</p>

<p>
For the lizard, suddenly and mysteriously endowed
with life, sprang straight at him, its scaly body
colliding with his hand.
</p>

<p>
Te Karearea's club clattered to the ground, and his
limbs, stiff with horror, held him rooted to the spot
after that one backward impulse; while the lizard,
its strange vitality extinguished as instantly as it
had been kindled, tumbled back inertly upon the
ridge.
</p>

<p>
'Liar!' shrieked the old man, shaking a warning
finger in the face of the trembling chief.  'Fool! who
thought to deceive the watchful TUMATAUENGA.
Hear now, O stupid Hawk, the word which the gods
have spoken to me.'
</p>

<p>
Te Karearea was badly stricken as it was, but his
eyes bulged as Kapua Mangu poured out the whole
history of the greenstone club from the moment
when Te Kaihuia had handed it to George.  He had
spoken with none but the chief since the arrival
of the Hau-haus, and yet the minutest details were
known to him, and he lashed Te Karearea with his
tongue until, compelled by exhaustion, he stopped
and staggered back against the tree.
</p>

<p>
Now was Te Karearea's opportunity to escape, and
he stooped swiftly to regain his club, keeping a wary
eye upon the lizard, when suddenly he discerned
around the body of the <i>tuatara</i> a thin cord of
blackened flax, indistinguishable in the gloom, unless
closely looked for.  Te Karearea drew his mat across
his face so that he might indulge in a quiet grin.
</p>

<p>
Presently Kapua Mangu, having got his second
wind, advanced to complete the humiliation of the
chief; but to his amazement, he detected a decided
sneer on Te Karearea's thin lips.
</p>

<p>
'Beware, O stupid Hawk!' he yelled fiercely.
'Beware, lest I deliver you into the power of the
tuatara.'
</p>

<p>
For answer Te Karearea snatched up the cord,
wrenched the end from the magician's hand, and
slung the lizard from him with a derisive laugh.  It
fell just within the circle of heads.
</p>

<p>
The chief was somewhat taken aback by this,
which he certainly had not intended; but he
preserved a bold front, poked out his tongue until it
almost reached his chest, and rolled his eyes frightfully.
</p>

<p>
But Kapua Mangu, confronted thus by such an
uncivil infidel, set up a howl of horror.
</p>

<p>
'<i>Aue!  Aue!</i>' he wailed.  'Alas for the House of
Te Turi.'
</p>

<p>
Tears ran from his aged eyes, and his gaunt body
shook with a terror which was quite unfeigned.
</p>

<p>
'<i>Hi!  Hi!</i>' exclaimed Te Karearea.  'What a fuss
about nothing.  I saw the cord with which you made
him jump.  He cannot hurt.'
</p>

<p>
'Nay, nay,' protested Kapua Mangu mournfully;
'you are a fool.  It was for your sake I put the cord
upon him.  Had I not pulled him back when he
jumped, he would have devoured you before my
eyes.'
</p>

<p>
This was an entirely new view of the situation,
and the self-satisfied grin faded from Te Karearea's
face.  The old superstitions were tugging at him
once more.  'I will bring him back,' he said humbly,
and took a hesitating step in the direction of the
heads.
</p>

<p>
Kapua Mangu was genuinely frightened, but, being
by no means certain that anything would happen, he
felt compelled to regain his ascendency by thoroughly
frightening the chief once more.  So he drew largely
upon a vivid imagination in order to restrain the
foolhardy infidel.
</p>

<p>
'Stay, fool!' he shrieked.  'The spirits of the dead
are angry.  There is Te Pouri whom you slew, and
Te Kaihuia whom you sped upon the road to Reinga.
They are talking to one another.  They are nodding
their heads and saying: "Here comes the stupid
Hawk.  Let us seize him and&mdash;&mdash;"  Ah-h-h!'
</p>

<p>
It is impossible to describe the long-drawn, quavering
scream which brought the poor wizard's ravings
to a sudden close.  Never was venerable sorcerer so
completely taken aback, so utterly horrified at the
success of his own magic.
</p>

<p>
For, as it happened, his last coherent words exactly
described the behaviour of two of the heads.  Incredible
to relate, they were nodding at one another, and
gruesome enough was the sight in that gloomy
underworld.  It was too much for the old <i>tohunga</i>,
and with another yell of fear and horror, he fled
from the awful scene which, as he fully believed,
his own magic had evoked.
</p>

<p>
More scared by the wild talk of the wizard than
he would have cared to admit, Te Karearea glanced
over his shoulder at that first panic-stricken yell.
Then he turned his head again, and his own blood
froze.
</p>

<p>
For he, too, now saw the nodding heads and&mdash;oh,
fearsome sight!&mdash;their voiceless conference at an end,
the pair came rushing at him with a strange, bobbing
motion, enough of itself to scare any wretched mortal.
But, as if that were not sufficient, the two frolicsome
heads stopped suddenly in their wild career, threw
themselves back, and burst into peal upon peal of
harsh, demoniac laughter.
</p>

<p>
It was the last straw.  One horrified look Te
Karearea cast behind him in frenzied appeal to the
<i>tohunga</i>, and thus becoming aware of that ancient
fraud, who with flapping mat and twinkling, skinny
legs, raced along the back-track, he turned and
rushed after the discomfited magician, who just then
afforded an admirable example of an 'engineer hoist
with his own petard.'
</p>

<p>
No sooner did the chief take to his heels, than a
still more singular phenomenon was exhibited; for
the two heads developed bodies, arms, and legs, not
to speak of trousers and boots, materialising, the one
into George, the other into Terence.  The latter
caught up the torch from the ridge, the former
secured the two heads with whose personality they
had made so free, and together they sped after the
vanishing couple, who were much too scared to think
of looking behind them.
</p>

<p>
As they passed an immense jumble of logs and
broken boughs, George dropped the heads into the
midst of it.  'This place may be useful to us by and
by,' he said, 'and if those two return and find them
lying about, they will smell a rat.'
</p>

<p>
Terence burst into a sputtering laugh.  'I thought
I should have died when you squatted on your hocks
and went hopping down on the chief.  And the face
of his mightiness!  Oh, oh, oh!  I shall never forget
it.'
</p>

<p>
'Steady, old fellow!' cautioned George, with a
responsive grin.  'It's an ill wind that blows nobody
good, and the chief's scare has proved our salvation.'
</p>

<p>
Closely following Te Karearea's line of flight, they
soon passed through a hole into the midst of some thick
bushes.  Then the cool night air blew in their faces,
and overhead blazed the myriad stars of the southern
sky.  They were in the upper world once more.
</p>

<p>
But what was their surprise when the black mass
of the stockade surrounding the <i>pah</i> loomed in front
of them, some forty rods away.  There was no doubt
of it; for far below them, across the river, they
could see the twinkling fires of the bivouac in the
forest, while in the intense stillness the splash and
scurry of the leaping water in the cañon came
plainly to their ears.
</p>

<p>
'It is clear that we were all kept off the hill to-night
in order that our ancient friend might introduce the
chief unobserved into the secret haunt we have just
left,' said Terence.
</p>

<p>
'And little did they dream that they would have
an audience,' put in George.  'I know a good deal
more about things than I did an hour ago.  Let us
go down and camp on the flat.  There are worse beds
than the heart of a flax-bush, and we shall be well
concealed in case they are hunting for us.  We are
sure to have been missed from the bivouac.'
</p>

<p>
'Let us take the bearings of this opening before we
go,' suggested Terence.  'How are we facing?
Ah! there's the Southern Cross.'
</p>

<p>
'This rock is a good guide,' said George.  'The
bushes hide the opening very completely, and I dare
say it can be further disguised.  I wonder if many
people know of it.'
</p>

<p>
'I should think not, and I am sure that the hole
by which we entered is not commonly known,' replied
Terence.  'We must do our best to find it again.'
</p>

<p>
They found the track and descended the hill to the
plain, hiding themselves as quickly as possible among
the flax-bushes near the river road.  Then George said:
</p>

<p>
'I will tell you to-morrow all that passed between
Te Karearea and Kapua Mangu, and why I am
regarded as such a valuable asset.  Why, the chief's
very existence appears to depend upon his success in
making a Pakeha-Maori of me.'
</p>

<p>
'Tell all about it,' pleaded Terence.
</p>

<p>
'You cormorant!  Haven't you had excitement
enough for one night?  Not a word&mdash;oh, just one.
If I lay the greenstone club aside, even for a moment,
and you are by, call my attention to it at once,
please.  Otherwise things may happen.'
</p>

<p>
'You mean creature!  How do you expect me to
sleep in peace?' complained Terence.  'I shall dream
all night of you and your magic club.'
</p>

<p>
George curled himself up in the heart of a
flax-bush.  'Don't tread upon me if your dreams make
you walk in your sleep,' he laughed.  'I'm for bed.'
</p>

<p>
'Me too,' said Terence.  'I'm looking for a soft
spot.'
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XV
<br /><br />
POKEKE, THE SULLEN ONE
</h3>

<p>
It was high day when George awoke, and the sweet,
confused odours that stole from the forest on the
breath of the morning filled him with a pleasant
sense of well-being as he stretched his great limbs
and rubbed the last mists of sleep out of his eyes.
A few paces away Terence still slept; but George,
without awaking him, set himself to study the lie
of the land.
</p>

<p>
It was an exquisite scene, full of light and colour.
The sombre green of the dense bush encircling the
island was flecked with the glowing scarlet of <i>rata</i>
blossoms and the beautiful white stars of the
clematis which garlanded and festooned the tall trees,
while with harsh scream and cackle occasional flocks
of parrakeets swept by in glancing flight, the crimson
and green of their gaudy wings flashing in the
sunshine like fragments of a rainbow.  It was difficult
to realise that, a mile or less away, five or six
hundred grim-faced warriors lurked in the peaceful
forest glades.
</p>

<p>
But it was in no romantic mood that George took
his bearings, for his dominant wish was to discover
some way out of the trap in which they were set,
and which he meant to leave as soon as possible after
having withdrawn his parole.
</p>

<p>
The whole of the island plain was densely covered
with New Zealand flax,[<a id="chap15fn1text"></a><a href="#chap15fn1">1</a>] the ground being for the
most part swampy, save close to the road, from hill
to river.  Once among these flax-clumps, George
thought, a hard-pressed fugitive would have an
excellent chance of escape; for the so-called flax-bush
is a collection of broad, stiff, upstanding leaves, tough
enough to stop a bullet, and dense enough to conceal
a man, who might dodge from bush to bush and
reach the river in safety.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="poem">
<a id="chap15fn1"></a>
[<a href="#chap15fn1text">1</a>] <i>Phormiun tenax</i>: not the true flax.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
'That is the most satisfactory bit of landscape,'
murmured unpoetic George, and had just turned to
greet Terence, who had hailed him, when a voice close
behind him said:
</p>

<p>
'Salutations, Hortoni, and to you, Mura, salutations.
I have looked for you since the dawn.  Where
did you sleep last night?'
</p>

<p>
'Here,' replied George, determined not to give away
the least advantage by overmuch speech.
</p>

<p>
'Why did you leave the bivouac?'
</p>

<p>
'I think the bivouac left us.'  George smiled
pleasantly.  'We woke to find it deserted, and such
a dreadful racket arose that it was impossible to
sleep through the din.'  He interpreted to Terence,
who nodded emphatically, preferring this method on
account of his admitted tendency to 'open his mouth
and put his foot in it.'
</p>

<p>
'And so you removed to this side?' pursued the
chief.
</p>

<p>
'We had very little inducement to remain on the
other,' said George truthfully.  'What was the cause
of that terrific noise?'
</p>

<p>
'Night is the council-time of the Maori,' Te Karearea
replied.  'I and my people were met together.  Then
Paeroa returned with men of Ngatiawa and Waikato,
and reported that a band of Arawa dogs had followed
at his heels.  Thereafter arose a cry that spies were
lurking in the scrub.'
</p>

<p>
The furtive brown eyes, steady for once, stared
hard at George, whose expression was one of genuine
surprise.
</p>

<p>
This was news indeed, if true.  Nothing would more
effectually divert suspicion from them than the
supposed proximity of Arawa scouts.  George had much
ado to conceal his satisfaction; but all he said was,
after interpreting to Terence: 'Can we still get
breakfast at the camp, Chief?  We have slept late.'
</p>

<p>
'Kawainga weeps for your absence,' returned the
Maori, with an ironical grin.  'Go and see.'  He was
evidently puzzled, and, as he turned to go, informed
them: 'At noon I enter the <i>pah</i> with my warriors.
Be ready, Hortoni, for I desire that you and Mura
should enter it with me as honoured guests.'
</p>

<p>
George bowed low, the corners of his mouth
twitching, and, with a dignified gesture of farewell,
the chief drew his mat about his shoulders and
stalked away up the hill.
</p>

<p>
After breakfast Terence strolled off to take a look
at the reinforcements, and, while George sat quietly
on a log, smoking, Kawainga appeared and began to
collect the wooden plates and tin cups.  Once, as she
passed him, she said almost in a whisper: 'Paeroa
waits on the bush track where the river forks'; and
again, as she repassed with her hands full: 'Hasten,
Hortoni, for when the shadows shorten the Hawk
will return.'
</p>

<p>
George made no sign that he heard, but as soon as
the girl had withdrawn, looked at his watch and
strolled carelessly along the track towards the river.
There was not too much time, for it was nearly
half-past eleven; but he felt that he must learn what
Paeroa wanted with him, knowing that the man
would not have sent him such a message and in such
a way for nothing.
</p>

<p>
By the river bridge he stopped as if undecided
which way to go, then turned to the left and followed
the bank towards the fork.  Half-way thither he
stopped again, hands in pockets, and one foot idly
kicking up the soil.  He was the picture of a man
with nothing to do.  Note that he was standing now
in the clearing between the bush and the river, about
midway between the two.
</p>

<p>
While he loitered there, his greenstone club slipped
from his belt to the ground, and without the loss of
a moment he stooped to recover it.  As he did so, a
bullet hummed over his bending head, and he heard
the sharp smack of a gun close by.
</p>

<p>
Once again the <i>mere</i> had been the means of saving
his life; for, had he remained erect, he must have
been shot through the head.
</p>

<p>
Confusion seized George's brain as he snatched up
the club and bounded into the bush in search of the
assassin.  As he broke through the fringing trees, he
saw Terence, fists up, waiting for a burly Maori to
rise from the ground.  No sooner had the fellow
found his feet than the Irishman hit him a terrific
blow on the point of the chin, and down he went
again into the fern and lay senseless.
</p>

<p>
'Oh, it was you he was after then,' cried George.
'He nearly hit me, all the same.'
</p>

<p>
'Naturally,' Terence observed drily.  'He was taking
careful aim at you when I spotted him.  He pulled
off before I could reach him, but next minute I
knocked him down.  It is a good thing you saw him
and ducked in time.'
</p>

<p>
'But I didn't see him,' George said rather wearily.
'The instant before that shot was fired, the
greenstone club slipped through my belt to the ground,
though I had secured it ten minutes earlier.  As I
stooped to raise it, the bullet passed over my head.'
</p>

<p>
Terence's eyes grew round.  'What are we to make
of this?' he said.
</p>

<p>
'This much.  The fellow&mdash;who, I see, is one of the
new contingent&mdash;was watching for me.  When he
saw me separated from the <i>mere</i>, he fired, supposing
me vulnerable.'
</p>

<p>
'No.'  Terence shook his head.  'He rested his gun
in the fork of that sapling, and took careful aim at
you as you stood.  He could not possibly know that
you would drop the club at that particular moment.
I don't suppose he even knows you have it, as you
say he is one of the new men.'
</p>

<p>
'But you don't mean to argue that the <i>mere</i> slipped
out of my belt in order to open a way of escape for
me?'
</p>

<p>
'That is exactly what happened, at all events.'
</p>

<p>
'And you had nothing to do with the matter?'  Terence
shook his head, and George, passing his hand
in a dazed way across his brow, said: 'I can't think
of anything just now.  Besides, I must go.  I'll  tell
you where later on.  Can you manage to take that
fellow back to the camp?'
</p>

<p>
'Rather,' affirmed Terence; 'but you may as well
tell him, that, if he doesn't go quietly, I will lodge one
of his own bullets in him.'
</p>

<p>
George gave the required hint to the Hau-hau,
who scowled.  Then he dashed out of the bush,
almost upsetting Te Karearea, who was standing in
the open.
</p>

<p>
'Can he be at the bottom of this latest outrage?'
thought George.  'Confound him, I shall not be able
to meet Paeroa.  Well, it can't be helped.'  No; but
the missing of that interview meant more to George
than he dreamed of at the time.
</p>

<p>
'Whither do you run so fast, Hortoni?' demanded
the chief.
</p>

<p>
'Did you hear a shot just now?' returned George,
eyeing him.
</p>

<p>
'I heard it.  One of my fools was firing at a parrot,
or, perhaps, a pig.'
</p>

<p>
'In the eyes of your "fool" I stood for one or
the other,' said George, still staring at the chief.
'That shot was aimed at me; but, as the trigger
was pulled, I stooped to pick up something I had
dropped.'
</p>

<p>
'No one would dare,' Te Karearea cried stormily.
</p>

<p>
'The man fired to kill,' insisted George.  'Mura saw
him and knocked him down, and is even now taking
him to be judged by you.'
</p>

<p>
'Ha!  Then Mura saved your life?'
</p>

<p>
George met him eye to eye.  'Nay, O Hawk,' he said
quietly; 'I owe my life, under God's providence, to
the <i>mere</i> of TUMATAUENGA.'
</p>

<p>
Te Karearea started violently.  'Again!' he
muttered.  'Again!'  Then: 'Come with me, Hortoni, and
we will deal with this breaker of laws.'
</p>

<p>
'Mura's hand has already fallen heavily upon him,'
said George, as they moved away.  He did not notice
Paeroa, who peered from behind a tree near the fork,
and immediately darted into the bush.  But Te
Karearea's keen eyes saw him, though he said not a
word to George.
</p>

<p>
They reached the camp just as Terence emerged
from the bush with his prisoner.  At once there was
a rush of the new arrivals towards their comrade,
whose appearance was deplorable, for his nose had
bled freely, and his eyes were almost closed.  The
Maoris hung back for a moment as Terence levelled
his rifle, and Te Karearea, taking advantage of the
pause, sprang to meet them, crying: 'Back, dogs, or I
will loose upon you the <i>mere</i> of TUMATAUENGA!'
</p>

<p>
At this dread threat the Hau-haus recoiled, and Te
Karearea whispered a sharp aside to George: 'Quick!
Give me the club.  If the fools see it in my hand,
they will know that I have not told them a tale.'
</p>

<p>
He was a great actor, this Te Karearea; but
George was not taken in.  'I will show it to them,
Chief,' he said, stepping to the front.
</p>

<p>
'Behold the <i>mere</i> of TUMATAUENGA!' he began, when
there arose a great commotion, and Te Karearea
uttered a cry of warning.  The Maori whom Terence
had battered, rendered reckless by rage and pain,
wrenched a rifle from the nearest of his compatriots,
rushed at George, and yelling, 'Die, accursed Pakeha!'
pushed the muzzle within a few inches of his chest
and pulled the trigger.
</p>

<p>
With a shout of horror, Terence sprang forward;
but, to the utter amazement of all, George, who still
stood erect, holding up the <i>mere</i>, reversed the weapon
and with a quiet smile brought it down sharply upon
the head of his would-be murderer, who for the third
time that morning measured his length on the
ground.
</p>

<p>
With a feeling that the world was turning upside
down, Terence stared at his friend, while deep-toned
exclamations expressed the bewilderment of the
Maoris.  There was the burn upon the Pakeha's
coat, just over the heart.  'Na!  The <i>mere</i> of
TUMATAUENGA was strong indeed when it could
turn a bullet like that.  Na!  Best let the Pakeha
alone and save themselves, lest his magic make
short work of them, even as it had done of Pokeke&mdash;the
Sullen One&mdash;who had fired the shot.'  With one
accord they bolted out of reach of this dealer in
magic and spells.
</p>

<p>
With Terence gazing, wonder-struck, and Te
Karearea glancing fearfully at him, George still
stood with rigid muscles and set smile, though he was
deadly pale.  He was, indeed, as much amazed as
any of them at his marvellous escape.  So many
queer things had happened, that it never occurred to
him then, any more than to the least intelligent
among the Hau-haus, that in the hurry of loading
an unfamiliar weapon, the Maori who owned the
gun had probably forgotten to put in the wad over
the ball, which had naturally rolled out of the barrel
long before the gun was fired.[<a id="chap15fn2text"></a><a href="#chap15fn2">2</a>]
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="poem">
<a id="chap15fn2"></a>
[<a href="#chap15fn2text">2</a>] A fact.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
For all his outward coolness, he was shaken and
spent, and it was only by the supremest effort that
he managed to control his quivering nerves and
stand there, calm and smiling, as if he had anticipated
this very result.
</p>

<p>
Te Karearea was almost as frightened as were his
men, and the temptation he felt to run along with
them warred hard against the necessity for keeping
up his dignity in their presence.  But his iron will
conquered, and presently he turned to George and
said with a forced smile: 'Teach me your magic,
Hortoni, I pray you.  We Hau-haus claim to be
invulnerable in battle, but&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
But George, now that the strain was lifted, felt
suddenly limp and intensely desirous of being left
alone.  So with a protesting wave of the hand he
cut into the chief's speech.  'Another time, O Hawk
of the Mountain, we will talk of this wonder.  Now
I go to give thanks to my God, who is stronger than
TUMATAUENGA, and who twice within the hour has
saved me from death.'
</p>

<p>
He was about to withdraw when a thought struck
him, and, pointing to the prostrate Pokeke, he said:
'I claim that man to do with as I will.'
</p>

<p>
'He is yours,' Te Karearea assented laconically,
and, closely followed by Terence, George entered the
bush and disappeared.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XVI
<br /><br />
SPLENDIDE MENDAX
</h3>

<p>
George, as has been said, had never thought of the
simple explanation of the amazing incident just
related; but he readily accepted it when suggested
by Terence, for his healthy mind revolted from the
constant association with the apparently supernatural
which circumstances forced upon him.  It
was better and wiser, he felt, to esteem these
mysterious happenings capable of eventual solution,
than to drift into the habit of regarding them as
inexplicable by natural means.
</p>

<p>
'If it ever comes to a fight, you will have it all
your own way,' laughed Terence, 'for none of them
will have the nerve to tackle you.'
</p>

<p>
'When I left home, I had no idea that I should
become a person of such importance,' George said,
smiling.  'Come; let us get back to the chief.'
</p>

<p>
As they appeared at the edge of the clearing,
Te Karearea came up all smiles and explanations;
but the Hau-haus looked askance at them,
those nearest to them hastening to increase their
distance.
</p>

<p>
'I have postponed the march for two hours,' the
chief informed them.  'I had no wish to disturb
your devotions, Hortoni, and also, I did not wish to
enter the <i>pah</i> without you.  Meantime, Kawainga
makes ready your meal.'
</p>

<p>
George acknowledged the courtesy, and, inquiring
what had become of Pokeke, was informed that he
had been sent ahead to the <i>pah</i> with Paeroa for
his guard.
</p>

<p>
'Has anything been heard of the Arawa spies?'
asked George.
</p>

<p>
'No,' replied the chief, with twinkling eyes.  'It
was Paeroa who judged them to be Arawas; but we
know better.'
</p>

<p>
'We!' echoed George.  'What can I know about
them?'  He spoke haughtily, while Terence, to whom
he rapidly interpreted, assumed what he honestly
believed to be an expression of most virtuous
indignation.
</p>

<p>
'You can answer that best, Hortoni,' the chief said
quickly; 'but, even for one so beloved of the gods as
yourself, it is unwise to run too many risks.'
</p>

<p>
'You speak in riddles,' George began still more
distantly, when he was interrupted by an outrageous
noise at the outskirts of the camp, where two men
were cutting chips from an immense log.  In the
twinkling of an eye this innocent occupation changed
to a furious conflict; for six strange Maoris sprang
from the fern behind the giant trunk and savagely
attacked the hewers, whose roars for aid set
the Hau-haus rushing towards them from all sides.
</p>

<p>
Realising that they could not fight a host, the six
spies&mdash;for such they were&mdash;took to their heels;
but one remained behind, cloven from shoulder to
midriff by a mighty stroke from a hewer's axe.
The others got clear away, for Te Karearea sternly
checked pursuit, and, running up to the big log,
hastily scrutinised the corpse.
</p>

<p>
'Arawa!' he shouted excitedly.  'Dogs of Arawa!
They it was who spied upon us last night.'
</p>

<p>
He spurned the body with his foot, and the Hau-haus
instantly flung themselves upon it, and with
revolting accompaniments hacked it to pieces.
</p>

<p>
'Then that story was true after all,' George said
in a low voice.  'We are safe; for I am sure the
chief has no suspicion of our presence in the
underground world.'
</p>

<p>
'No; and in my opinion&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
What Terence's opinion was, George was not to
learn, for just then a spattering volley rattled in
the bush, several bullets hummed past them, and
they bolted for cover.  In a moment the clearing was
empty, and the Hau-haus, sheltered behind the great
trunks, answered the challenge with a random fire.
</p>

<p>
Te Karearea had thrown aside his mats, and now,
naked like his warriors, save for his waist-cloth and
huia plumes, was dodging actively from tree to tree,
firing with great coolness whenever he saw a chance.
But, owing to the thick bush, little harm was done on
either side, and to the interested onlookers the affair
seemed very like a stale mate.
</p>

<p>
But Te Karearea had always to be reckoned with.
No sooner had the spies fled, than he dispatched
Winata Pakaro with fifty men to make a rapid
flanking march and ascertain whether they had to
do with a large force or a <i>mere</i> screen of scouts.
In either case Winata had his orders, which he
carried out to the letter, and in a few moments from
the firing of the first shot, the clearing was filled
with a mob of yelling combatants, and a hand-to-hand
fight in the good old style began.  The muskets,
useless now, were flung away, or swung by the barrel,
while tomahawk and club clashed and jarred and
rattled in the shock of their meeting.
</p>

<p>
Presently the watchers heard Te Karearea's voice
raised in a shout of savage triumph.  '<i>Mataika!
Mataika!</i>' he yelled, and, grasping a young Arawa
chief by the hair with his left hand, dashed out the
man's brains with a single blow of the heavy club
in his right.  '<i>Mataika!</i>' he yelled again.  '<i>Ki au te
Mataika!</i>' and, brandishing the blood-stained <i>mere</i>,
dashed into the midst of the foe.
</p>

<p>
'Is that his battle-cry?' called Terence from behind
his tree.
</p>

<p>
'No.  The first to be killed in a fight is called the
<i>Mataika</i>,' explained George.  '"I have the <i>Mataika</i>"
is the cry of the successful slayer, and duels often
arise after a battle, owing to disputes among the
claimants to the honour.'
</p>

<p>
The Arawas, taken thus in the rear, and hopelessly
outnumbered, had no chance, and the end of the
skirmish came when some twenty of the brave, rash
fellows&mdash;all that were left of fifty&mdash;broke through
the packed masses of their enemies and fled,
unpursued, through the bush.
</p>

<p>
'The Hawk has all the luck,' grumbled George.
'What a piece of folly for so small a force to attack
five hundred!'
</p>

<p>
'Never mind,' Terence said cheerfully.  'It shows,
at all events, that some one is on our trail, and that
our sweet chief is not to be allowed to have everything
his own way.  Here he comes.  Lo, what a
swelling port!'
</p>

<p>
Te Karearea stalked up to them, his chest heaving,
his eyes still aflame with the fierce light of battle.
His scarred visage looked grimmer than ever as he
grinned balefully at his 'guests.'
</p>

<p>
'Ha!  Even without the <i>mere</i> of TUMATAUENGA,
it seems that we can still win a fight,' he said
truculently.
</p>

<p>
'You outnumbered the Arawas by ten to one,'
began George, but added hastily, as the chief's
brows knit in a frown: 'That flanking movement
to take a probable foe in the rear was fine generalship.'
</p>

<p>
Te Karearea was never above nicely judged flattery.
'Praise from a soldier's son!  That is good,' he said,
nodding his plumed head.  'Had you been fighting
by my side, Hortoni, not one of the dogs had escaped.
Why not become my Pakeha?'
</p>

<p>
'One might really do worse,' returned George
lightly.  'You have all the luck.'  Whereat the
chief looked mightily pleased.
</p>

<p>
'We will talk of this again, Hortoni,' he said.  'I
remember that your parole expires to-night.  Will
you renew your promise?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes,' George answered at once.
</p>

<p>
A gleam of suspicion came into the chief's eyes at
this ready concession.  'For how long, Hortoni?  A
week?  A moon?  What?'
</p>

<p>
'I promise; that is enough,' returned George
carelessly.  'When I am tired of liberty I will tell you.'
</p>

<p>
Te Karearea's eyes burned into his own, but he
met their stare unflinchingly, and presently the chief
said: 'And you, O Mura&mdash;whom I had not forgotten&mdash;do
you also give your word?'
</p>

<p>
'Oh yes,' replied Terence, when George had interpreted.
</p>

<p>
Once again Te Karearea stared at them as if he
would read their inmost thoughts.  Then with a curt
'It is good!' he stalked away, and they heard his
voice ringing out as he issued orders with regard to
the twice-interrupted march.
</p>

<p>
They stood on one side, watching the eager Maoris,
fine men for the most part, and handsome too,
despite the intricate patterns which scored their
faces&mdash;records, each of them, of some deed of derring-do.
For the Maori, not content with simple tattooing,
cut and carved his history upon brow and breast
and cheek and chin, the absence of such scars
indicating either extreme youth, or a lack of courage
very rare among the men of their race.
</p>

<p>
'He is beckoning to us.  Come along,' said Terence.
'You first, please, by reason of your exalted position.'
</p>

<p>
Te Karearea, who had resumed his mat and kilt,
cordially greeted them as they fell in on either side
of him, and amid inexpressible uproar the march to
the <i>pah</i> began.
</p>

<p>
But presently the men settled down, and, as they
took the road across the island to the hill, broke
into a roaring chorus of the days when all the land
was their birthright, and again, of the time to come
when the Pakeha should be swept into the sea, and
<i>Ao-Tea-Roa</i>,[<a id="chap16fn1text"></a><a href="#chap16fn1">1</a>] the Land of the Long-lingering Day,
return to the Children of Maui once more.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap16fn1"></a>
[<a href="#chap16fn1text">1</a>] New Zealand was thus poetically named by the early Maori
settlers there because of the twilight, to which they had been
unaccustomed in 'Hawaiki.'
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
George, toiling up the steep and difficult ascent,
and wondering how, when their parole was withdrawn,
they should ever escape from such a stronghold
as that upon the hill-top, was startled out of
his reverie by the sound of a harsh, dry sob.  He
glanced round, to find Te Karearea, with bowed head
and anguished face, stumbling almost blindly along
the rough track.
</p>

<p>
'<i>Aue! Aue!</i>' wailed the chief, his low, tense tones
scarcely reaching beyond the ear of him for whom
they were intended.  '<i>Aue!</i>  Oh, that the <i>mere</i> of
TUMATAUENGA might be mine but for one short hour,
that the god might see it in the hand of the last of
the House of Te Turi!  Oh, that I might bear it into
the <i>pah</i>, and hold it while I pray to the gods and to
my ancestors.  Only for one little hour.  <i>Aue!  Aue!</i>'
</p>

<p>
He made no direct appeal, but his restless brown
eyes dwelt wistfully on George, who felt distinctly
uncomfortable.
</p>

<p>
They had reached a point some three hundred feet
below the outer palisades of the <i>pah</i>, and now George
saw for the first time, what had been invisible from
the plain, that some convulsion of Nature had cloven
the hill into two unequal parts.  The gash ran clear
across the face of the hill, forming a deep gulch with
precipitous sides of jagged rock.  The chasm, like
the river, was bridged, but more securely, and provided
with hand-rails of twisted flax which also served
as draw-ropes.
</p>

<p>
Believing, as he did most firmly, that his own fate
and the fate of his House depended upon his possession
of the greenstone club, Te Karearea's emotion
was not altogether feigned, and George, despite the
knowledge that his own life would not be worth a
day's purchase if he surrendered the <i>mere</i>, felt again
that throb of sympathy for this man who pleaded
for what meant to him his very existence.
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, and though he grew more uncomfortable
than ever, his resolution hardened not to
yield the club while he had strength to retain it; so,
to avoid the sight of Te Karearea's woebegone face,
he moved a pace or two ahead of the chief.
</p>

<p>
They had come almost to the centre of the great
tree which spanned the chasm, and the main body
had halted at the bridge-head in order not to incommode
the chief and his 'guests' during the crossing,
which, if not actually dangerous, was a matter
requiring caution.  For, though wide enough to allow
the three to walk abreast, the bridge was yet so
narrow, that the right arm of George and the left
arm of Terence brushed the ropes.
</p>

<p>
But Te Karearea was desperate.  Ignoring the
warning that guile, not force, must be employed to
recover the <i>mere</i>, or that only by voluntary
surrender or carelessness on the part of Hortoni could
it become his own, he made a sudden snatch at the
club, which hung rather in front of George's right
hip.  The natural consequence followed.  George
moved on with long, swinging stride just as Te
Karearea stooped with eagerly extended hand, the
chief missed the club, lost his balance, and, in full
view of the horrified spectators, rolled over the
bridge.
</p>

<p>
A howl of dismay went up from the Maoris, and
George, turning sharply, saw with amazed eyes the
unfortunate chief sliding head-downwards into the
profound abyss.
</p>

<p>
Without a thought of his own danger, George flung
himself down upon his face with hands outstretched,
and succeeded, only just in time, in seizing the chief's
left ankle, to which he clung with the tenacity of
desperation.
</p>

<p>
For the position was now awful in the extreme.
Head downwards over that frightful abyss the chief
hung, held back from instant and dreadful death
only by the strong clutch of his intrepid captive, who,
with his own arms and face over the edge of the
trunk, looked down into the horrid rift into which he
was slowly being dragged.
</p>

<p>
But Terence was to the fore as well, and down he
went on his knees and hung on to his friend's legs
with all the strength of his mighty muscles.  Then
he shouted to Winata Pakaro, who ran lightly across
the bridge, stooped over the edge, and caught Te
Karearea's right ankle, thus allowing George to take
a fresh grip of the left.
</p>

<p>
And so, in a somewhat undignified manner, the
great chief was hauled slowly back from what a
moment earlier had seemed, and a moment later
would have been, certain death.
</p>

<p>
No loud expressions of delight greeted Te Karearea
as he resumed the perpendicular; for every Maori
there had seen his attempt to possess himself of the
greenstone club, and noted, too, the swift and terrible
retribution which, by the magic of the Pakeha, had
overtaken him.  Truly, the magician had chosen to
arrest the fall of the victim, but not until he had
given striking evidence of his power.
</p>

<p>
While the Maoris murmured together, Te Karearea
addressed George in a voice a little less firm than
usual: 'I thank you, Hortoni.  There is a bond
between us; for I owe you my life.'
</p>

<p>
'Not so, O Chief,' answered George coldly.  'You
saved my life aboard the brig; so now we are quits.'
</p>

<p>
Te Karearea merely nodded his head and echoed
George's remark: 'Very well, Hortoni; we are quits.'
</p>

<p>
'I wish you had let the rascal slip through your
hands,' remarked Terence, as they ascended the slope.
'It would have been a good riddance of a particularly
bad form of rubbish.  No, no,' he went on, reddening
as George looked at him; 'I don't mean that.  You
couldn't have done it.  Original instincts too strong
and all that.  I&mdash;oh, you know.'
</p>

<p>
'You need not apologise.' George smiled.  'The
thought actually crossed my mind as I held him up.'
</p>

<p>
'He is brave, George.  He bore that ordeal as few
could or would have done.  Perhaps it is a pity that
he is not on our side.'
</p>

<p>
'No, no,' said George, with a passionate gesture.
'If there be any excuse for his slyness, his lies, his
murders, it is in the fact that he acts as he does in
the sacred name of patriotism.  Were he in arms
against his own race, and still displayed his present
characteristics, he would be intolerable.'
</p>

<p>
'Here he comes back,' exclaimed Terence; 'and
beaming, by Jove!  What a man!'
</p>

<p>
The wily Te Karearea had been quick to perceive
the effect of his accident upon the emotional minds
of his countrymen, and with characteristic effrontery
set himself to efface the unfavourable impression.
Standing between the friends, he began a stirring
address to the warriors, who had now crossed the
bridge and were waiting to enter the <i>pah</i>, by the
outer gate of which were grouped the tohunga and
his small garrison, ready to welcome the conquering
chief.
</p>

<p>
With every trick of gesture and impassioned tone
of the born orator, he spoke to them until their fierce
eyes were fastened upon his own, and the sullen
apathy dropped from their stern faces.  Then, pausing,
he stepped back a pace, and, pointing to George
and Terence, cried: 'But here, my friends, are two
Pakehas whose hearts are even as those of the Maori.
You have seen for yourselves.  For if Hortoni and
Mura had not been my friends, they would have left
me to perish.  Here they stand, and'&mdash;his voice swelled
to a triumphant shout&mdash;'friends, they are ours!'
</p>

<p>
George had listened with growing impatience to
this splendid liar's talk, and at the final cunning
assertion he took an angry step forward.  But Te
Karearea had anticipated this, and ere he could
protest, turned about with a magnificent sweep of
his arm and pointed to the open gate of the <i>pah</i>.
</p>

<p>
Not another word was needed.  He had won.  Six
buglers blew prolonged, discordant blasts upon as
many great <i>teteres</i>,[<a id="chap16fn2text"></a><a href="#chap16fn2">2</a>] the garrison yelled shrilly, and
with a thunderous roar of triumph the impatient
Maoris surged forward, breasting the slope, and
charged furiously into the courtyard of the <i>pah</i>.

<h3>
CHAPTER XVII
<br /><br />
SAFE BIND, SAFE FIND
</h3>

<p>
When George Haughton managed to corner the
busy chief and wrathfully demand of him how
he had dared to claim him as a Pakeha-Maori, Te
Karearea met his remonstrances quietly, professing
himself astonished at the other's indignation.
</p>

<p>
'You said you might do worse,' he protested.  'I
took that for consent.  Besides, Hortoni, if you
had not been my friend, you would not have stood
between me and death.  It is absurd to argue about
so simple a matter.'  And he stalked off, leaving
George raging at his own incautiousness in having
ventured to bandy ironical chaff with such a master
of tricks.
</p>

<p>
Terence laughed when George reported the conversation.
</p>

<p>
'We must remember,' said he, 'that, thanks to
Te Karearea, the Hau-haus are inclined to be friendly;
but if we contradict his highness too energetically,
we shall find ourselves surrounded by malignant
enemies, and probably be separated.  I am for
making the best of it.'  And in this view George at
length concurred.
</p>

<p>
Events proved Terence right; for as time went on
they did what they liked, and no one attempted to
interfere with them.  Nevertheless, an uneasy feeling
that they were closely shadowed withheld them from
any exploration of the surrounding country, and
they wandered about, watching the girls at work on
the kumara[<a id="chap17fn1text"></a><a href="#chap17fn1">1</a>] fields across the river, inspecting the
bags of the hunters, and keenly interesting
themselves in the active preparations for war.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap17fn1"></a>
[<a href="#chap17fn1text">1</a>] Potato.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
'There is something in the wind,' George said one
day a fortnight after their arrival.  'I am told that
the war-dance was performed last night.  Now, a big
war-dance is a thing unknown except on the outbreak
of war, or just before a battle; so perhaps
word has come of the approach of our troops, or
there may be friendlies in the neighbourhood.'
</p>

<p>
'I noticed no particular excitement to-day,' observed
Terence.
</p>

<p>
'Perhaps not; but all the same some big military
movement is imminent.  If you could understand
their talk, you would have heard them boasting that
none of the dancers fainted or fell, which is always
considered a good omen.'
</p>

<p>
On the following afternoon, attracted by bursts of
laughter, the comrades turned into one of the long
lanes between the <i>whares</i>, and came upon a dozen
lads amusing themselves by casting clubs at a sort
of Maori equivalent to the 'Aunt Sally' of English
fairs.  The 'uncle,' as it was here, was grim enough,
being the dried head of one of the Arawas slain in
the recent fight.  On the crown of this dismal object
was set an empty beer-bottle, and to bring this down
without touching the head was the object of the
throwers.
</p>

<p>
But the more they threw, the more they missed,
which struck Terence as odd, and, at last, Te Karearea,
who was leaning nonchalantly against a door-post,
looking on, drew out his <i>mere</i> and stepped forward.
</p>

<p>
'Let us show these children what men can do,' he
said, and shivered the bottle at the first throw.
'Can you better that, Hortoni?'
</p>

<p>
'Perhaps I can equal it,' returned George, taking
his stand.  Te Karearea's eyes gleamed and flashed
a glance of intelligence at a lank youth who was
lounging near the mark, apparently uninterested.
</p>

<p>
Back swung George's arm; but as his right foot
was raised preparatory to the cast, his greenstone
club was plucked from his fingers, and he turned
sharply to find Terence smiling at him and holding
the precious weapon.
</p>

<p>
Without a word or a look at Te Karearea, George
thrust the club back into his belt and strode away.
Terence, however, lingered an instant to grin triumphantly
at the chief, in exchange for which attention
he received a scowl so hateful and malignant that he
thought it wise to follow his friend without delay.
</p>

<p>
The captives were greatly troubled by their
inability to discover the whereabouts of Paeroa,
Kawainga his betrothed, and Pokeke the Hau-hau,
not one of whom had been seen since the day of
their entrance into the <i>pah</i>.  George was convinced
that all three had been hidden away, if not killed
out of hand, in order to prevent them from coming
further under his influence; and concerning Paeroa
and his sweetheart he was sincerely distressed.
</p>

<p>
'It is intolerable to think that our pretty Morning
Star should be at the mercy of such an unscrupulous
brute as the chief,' Terence exclaimed angrily, as
they were discussing this question in their quarters
one stormy night.  'We must search for her and
Paeroa.  We have been here nearly three weeks, and
I think we might venture to begin.'
</p>

<p>
'Let us chance it,' agreed George.  'We will try
the under&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Salutations, friends!' said Te Karearea, appearing
in the doorway.  'I come to ask if you will renew
your parole.'
</p>

<p>
'We cannot renew what we have not withdrawn,'
George answered irritably.  He was wondering
how much the chief had heard.  'When we are
tired of liberty we will tell you.  There will be no
need for you to come and ask us.'
</p>

<p>
'The Pakehas are abominably deceitful,' Te Karearea
remarked absently.  'It is very difficult to know
when they are telling the truth.'
</p>

<p>
'How dare you say such a thing to us?' George
cried hotly; while Terence, when he understood,
flushed and glared at the chief.
</p>

<p>
'There is a bad spirit in you to-night, Hortoni,' the
Maori said smoothly.  'When you stopped me with
angry words, I was about to say that neither you nor
Mura would break your promises.'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, were you?' returned George, by no means
appeased.  'Hear now my word, O Hawk of the
Mountain, for it shall be the last.  Until we tell you
that we intend to take back our parole, we shall
respect it.'
</p>

<p>
'Until you tell me&mdash;not Winata Pakaro or another?'
queried the chief, darting glances at them.
</p>

<p>
'It is you to whom we are responsible,' answered
George curtly.
</p>

<p>
'Then, until I hear with my own ears from your
own mouths the words "We take back our parole,"
I may rest assured that you will make no attempt to
escape?' went on Te Karearea, with curious
persistence and a sharp anxiety of voice and manner
which George noticed but did not understand.
</p>

<p>
'You may,' he replied loftily.  'And for the future
do not come here with insults in your mouth.'
</p>

<p>
'It is well,' Te Karearea said suavely.  'Sleep
soundly, my friends, and dream of peace.'  After
a grave inclination, he drew his mat around his
shoulders and stalked out.
</p>

<p>
'What is at the back of all that, I wonder,' said
Terence.
</p>

<p>
'It was like his impudence to talk as he did,' fumed
George; 'but he does nothing without a reason.  But
I am too tired to solve conundrums.  Let us go to bed.'
</p>

<p>
Once or twice during the night Terence awoke and
sat up, listening to the extraordinary clamour of
wind and rain, in which, it seemed to him, a multitude
of tongues spoke softly, and the faint pad-pad of
naked feet made itself manifest.  But the noise of
the elements confused him, and it was not until
breakfast-time next morning that he mentioned his
fancies to George, who looked uncommonly grave as
he listened.
</p>

<p>
'Let us go and find out if anything did happen,' he
suggested as they rose from their meal; for he was
oppressed by an uncomfortable feeling that trouble
was in store for them.  His presentiment presently
grew stronger, for, as they walked towards the
<i>marae</i>, or open courtyard of the <i>pah</i>, the unusual
quiet of the long lanes surprised them, for the
inhabitants were early astir as a rule.
</p>

<p>
The court itself was deserted, save for two old
men, who sat upon a seat opposite to the open gates.
George looked down upon the plain, where a company
of women and children could be seen returning
from the bush across the river.  In anxious haste he
turned to one of the old men.
</p>

<p>
'Where is everybody, O my father?' he inquired.
'Where is Te Karearea?'
</p>

<p>
The old Maori shook his head and showed his
toothless gums.  'Nay; he is not here, Hortoni.  He
is gone to fight the Pakeha.'
</p>

<p>
'Gone to fight the Pakeha!' echoed George.  He
looked down again.  A band of armed Maoris had
issued from the bush and were crossing the river
bridge.  'Is that the Hawk returning?' he asked.
'Wake up, old man!'  He gently shook the ancient.
'Is it the Hawk who flies hither?'
</p>

<p>
The old fellow blinked drowsily in the warm sun.
'Nay; Te Karearea is gone to drive the Pakeha
into <i>Moana</i>.  Who knows when he will return?  Let
me slumber, Hortoni.'
</p>

<p>
George wheeled round upon Terence.  'The crafty
rascal!' he cried wrathfully.  'I see it all now.  It
was the noise of his departure that you heard in
the night, Terence.  Well might he scheme that we
should bind ourselves fast with our own words.  Oh,
if you had but woke me!  But now we have promised,
and&mdash;&mdash;'  He shook his fist in the direction of the
bush.  'Terence, we have been properly fooled.  We
are caught in a trap of our own making.'
</p>

<p>
'A parole extorted by such a piece of treachery
can hardly be considered binding,' objected Terence.
</p>

<p>
'Oh, we will keep our word, if only to shame him,
if that were possible.  But let the subtle Hawk look
out for himself when we do take back our parole.'
</p>

<p>
'And may I be there to see,' finished Terence,
taking his friend's arm.  'Let us go to meet those
people and learn the news.'
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap18"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XVIII
<br /><br />
PAEROA AT LAST
</h3>

<p>
As the comrades encountered the returning warriors,
who had been left as a garrison, their leader, a young
chief named Rolling Thunder, called out: 'Salutations,
Hortoni!  The Pakeha Eagle takes an early
flight; but he is too late to catch the Hawk, who
has gone to flesh his beak and talons.'
</p>

<p>
'He will meet with a few more eagles who will
make small account of his beak and talons,' answered
George grimly.  'When does he wing his way back
to his eyrie?  I mean, if he ever gets the chance.'
</p>

<p>
'Not until he has scattered the fragments of the
last Pakeha to the four winds,' replied Rolling
Thunder proudly, and marched off in high dudgeon at
their shouts of derisive laughter.
</p>

<p>
Just then Terence caught sight of a solitary figure
disappearing into the bush.  He recognised the man
as a <i>tutua</i>, or common fellow, named Sounding Sea,
one of the meanest and least considered Maoris in the
<i>pah</i>, whose sly face, destitute of scars, showed him
either a coward, or singularly to have lacked
opportunity to gain the right to heraldic distinctions.
Just then, however, there was nothing out of the
way in the fellow's behaviour, so Terence thought
no more about him.
</p>

<p>
'It is still very early, and I vote for exploration,'
he said to George.  Then he drummed idly on the
rail of the bridge, gazed down into the rushing
stream and sighed.  Presently he looked up at his
friend and smiled rather wistfully.  'I was thinking.
Bad habit; isn't it, old fellow?  Come; make up your
mind what to do.'
</p>

<p>
'Exploration be it,' agreed George.  'Let us look
for the hole into which you so gallantly dived.  Like
Quintus Curtius, it may yet prove that you took that
plunge for the good of your country.'
</p>

<p>
He spoke lightly, knowing well what was passing
in Terence's mind.  By tacit consent they seldom
referred to home or friends, finding the subject too
painful.  Terence had no near relations except his
mother's sister, to whom he was devoted; but his
affection for the Haughton circle was almost as deep
as that of George, and the peppery colonel and his
fine little brother-in-law held a very warm place in
his heart.  Many a silent prayer went up for their
own preservation and for those they loved; for these
two were brave and loyal lads, who had not learned
to forget God, and were not ashamed to show that
they maintained their trust in Him.
</p>

<p>
They easily found the hill upon which the Hau-hau
rites had been celebrated, but though they over and
over again made it their base of operations, failure
met them at each attempt to discover the entrance
to the underground world.
</p>

<p>
'We shall never find it,' said George; 'for even in
this short time the undergrowth has covered the
mouth of the hole.  We must try from the other
end; but if we lose ourselves&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'We can't&mdash;with this,' interposed Terence, holding
up a small, but perfect compass, made by one of
England's foremost opticians.  'I stole this from the
stealers, who were examining the contents of a looted
saddle-bag.  The compass had fallen to the ground
unnoticed, and, as my feet are adapted to cover much
bigger things, I calmly stood over it until I got a
chance to annex it.'
</p>

<p>
'Your petty larceny is condoned by the court,'
laughed George.  'I wish you could put your foot
upon a couple of good revolvers.'
</p>

<p>
'Don't move,' Terence said quickly.  'Look to
your right&mdash;three or four hundred yards
away&mdash;without appearing to do so.  There is a Maori
watching us.'
</p>

<p>
George looked and laughed again.  Apparently
there were half a dozen Maoris, squatting upon the
ground at irregular intervals, their long spears held
erect, their mats hanging down so as to conceal their
bodies.
</p>

<p>
'You are looking at a row of grass-trees,' George
explained.  'You are not the first to mistake a
grass-tree at a distance for a squatting native.'
</p>

<p>
'I did not say they were Maoris,' Terence replied
coolly.  'There were six grass-trees when I first
noticed them, and now there appear to be seven.
Aha!  Look, George.  Number seven is crawling off.
It is our friend Sounding Sea, who has been spying
on us.  I saw him dodging into the bush this morning,
and now that I am sure of his game, I may tell
you that I have suspected him for a week past.'
</p>

<p>
'What keen eyes you have to pick the fellow out,'
said George admiringly.  'In certain lights, and at a
distance, the illusion of the grass-tree is perfect.  It
is as well, perhaps, that we failed to find the hole,
since that rascal is on our track.'
</p>

<p>
'Well, we know where we stand now,' observed
Terence, 'and the gay Sounding Sea will find that
two can play the game of spying.  We will look for
Paeroa to-morrow in spite of him.'
</p>

<p>
Late next night the friends crept out of their
<i>whare</i>, which stood near the back of the stockade,
and searched for four hours in the underground
world; but they found no trace of the missing trio.
</p>

<p>
'We must get back before dawn,' said George;
'for Sounding Sea may take it into his head to pay
us an earlier visit than usual.  I don't think that
Paeroa is hidden down here.  The existence of the
place is known only to the privileged few, so there
would be no occasion to confine him far from the
entrance.'
</p>

<p>
'Besides, I fancy that both the chief and the wizard
would fight shy of the spot after their uncanny
experience.'  Terence chuckled at the recollection.
'Yes; come on.  We can't afford to take risks.'
</p>

<p>
Thrice they unsuccessfully explored the underground
reaches during the next fortnight; twice
they tried, and failed, to find the forest opening;
and then, suddenly, the face of the situation began
to alter.
</p>

<p>
It was now three weeks since Te Karearea had set
out for the front, and sick or wounded Maoris were
constantly filtering into the <i>pah</i>, one and all with
the same story to tell&mdash;the continued success of the
chief, and the impending annihilation of the detested
Pakeha.  The worst news they brought was that
of the death of old Kapua Mangu, who had been shot
while weaving a spell for the destruction of the
Arawas.  His head had been brought back to the <i>pah</i>,
and was now in the hands of the gentleman whose
business it was to preserve the grisly relic.
</p>

<p>
One night George entered their hut in a state
of great agitation.  His face was pale and his eyes
glittered; but for some time he sat silent, while
Terence watched him anxiously.
</p>

<p>
'Anything wrong, old fellow?' he inquired at last.
</p>

<p>
'Wrong! wrong!  Ay; it is all wrong together,'
burst out George.  'A devil is loose upon the earth,
and his name is Te Karearea.  He&mdash;he&mdash;&mdash;'  His
voice faltered, and he stopped for a moment.  Then,
ominously calm all at once, he resumed: 'News has
come that Te Karearea and a company of his
Hau-haus stole upon the settlement at Poverty Bay at
night and massacred&mdash;there's no other word for it,
for the poor people were quite unprepared&mdash;thirty-three
people.  And, Terence'&mdash;he covered his eyes with
his hand&mdash;'there were women and little children
among them.  Your friend Major Biggs was killed,
and&mdash;&mdash;'  He could say no more.
</p>

<p>
For a time the two sat without further speech.
They felt sick with horror; for the picture of those
helpless, anguished mothers and their babes would
obtrude itself.  But at last George sprang up and
shook his great shoulders, as if throwing off some
fearful oppression.
</p>

<p>
'Terence,' he said quietly, 'till now, in spite of
what I knew him to be capable of, I have had a
sneaking sympathy with this ruffian, with his
misfortunes, with his aspirations.  I knew that his point
of view must be different from ours.  I was inclined
to make allowances.  But now&mdash;now&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'I know,' Terence said in a low voice.  'It is&mdash;it is
those babies.'
</p>

<p>
George's strong teeth seemed to snap together.
'Yes; and he shall answer for them to me.'  Then
he went out into the night.
</p>

<p>
Next day, as they were sitting in the <i>marae</i>, a
wounded Maori came up and said, grinning: 'Pokeke
fights at the side of Te Karearea, and he constantly
mutters "The great axe of Heora."  He bade me tell
you this, Hortoni.'
</p>

<p>
George laughed contemptuously.  'This Heora is, I
believe, one of their mythical heroes,' he explained to
Terence.  'When a Maori frequently repeats the
words "The great axe of Heora," he means that he is
keeping his mind fast set upon revenge.  Well, this
settles the locality of one of our trio.'
</p>

<p>
'Yes; and it shows the value of any statement
made by Te Karearea,' put in Terence.  'Now I have
a piece of news,' he went on.  'I have discovered
something very queer about Sounding Sea.'
</p>

<p>
'What is it?' George asked, interested at once.
</p>

<p>
'About the same time every night he sneaks past
our hut&mdash;his own is almost opposite&mdash;towards the
back of the <i>pah</i>.  I followed him last night, and he
climbed the fence and dropped down on the narrow
ledge between the palisades and the edge of the
precipice.'
</p>

<p>
'Go on,' urged George.
</p>

<p>
'I was close behind him; yet, when I looked over,
he had disappeared.  The ledge runs about fifteen
feet on each side of the point where he scaled the
fence, which touches the edge of the cliff at the
angles.  So, as he could not have gone round, he
must have gone over.'
</p>

<p>
'And what are you going to do?'
</p>

<p>
'We will both follow him to-night after his visit.'
</p>

<p>
Under pretence that he had been detailed by Te
Karearea to see to their comfort, Sounding Sea came
to their hut at bed-time every night.  This night was
no exception, for his sly face peered round the door,
and he inquired, humbly enough, if the Pakeha lords
desired his services.
</p>

<p>
To throw him off his guard, George ordered him to
bring a basket of food, as they proposed to go for an
early ramble in the bush on the morrow.  When the
Maori returned with this, the friends were snoring
on their mats; so he placed it in a corner and
withdrew, satisfied.
</p>

<p>
Five minutes later Terence stole across to Sounding
Sea's <i>whare</i>, and returned almost immediately.
'There,' he said, with a gleeful chuckle, and thrust
a revolver and a handful of cartridges upon his
astonished friend.
</p>

<p>
'Kapua Mangu's mantle must have fallen on you,
you magician,' cried George, overjoyed.
'Where&mdash;how&mdash;&mdash;?'
</p>

<p>
'It occurred to me that Sounding Sea, not being
very courageous, would have made provision for
defending himself in case of a row with us,' explained
Terence; 'so I went to see.  The fellow has a regular
arsenal there.  I have brought away three revolvers
and any number of cartridges.'  He hid one of them
under his mat, along with a reserve of ammunition.
Then, having loaded their weapons, the friends stole
out on the track of the spy.
</p>

<p>
In a few minutes they stood upon the three-foot
ledge outside the <i>pah</i>, where a pale, watery moon
gave them light enough to see what they were about.
And this was as well; for movement, at the best, was
dangerous, and a slip might have been fatal.
</p>

<p>
'I thought as much,' exclaimed Terence, after
poking about in the grass.  'This explains our
gentleman's nocturnal trips, and I shouldn't wonder
if we were on the track of Paeroa.'
</p>

<p>
Lying on their faces, peering into the awful depths
of the cañon, they could see a strong flax ladder,
securely fastened to a couple of stout pegs, driven
into the ground between them.  By means of a
gentle tug they ascertained that the lower end of
the ladder was free, and, before George could
anticipate him, Terence swung himself over.
</p>

<p>
'I'll jerk three times when I reach the bottom,' he
said.  'Steady the thing for me.'
</p>

<p>
Presently the signal came, and George joined his
friend, who was standing upon a narrow ledge about
fifty feet below.  'Here we are,' said Terence in
greeting.  'This ledge runs in both directions.  Ah,
this is the way.  Look.'
</p>

<p>
A tangle of creepers, recently disturbed, guided
them, and they moved cautiously along the ledge,
which sloped very gradually downwards, until they
stood some twenty feet above the river, in full view
of a fine waterfall.  Thereafter was nothing but
sheer cliff to the broken water below.  Then while
they looked about, puzzled, Terence suddenly dragged
George down behind a shrub, and they saw a
wondrous sight.
</p>

<p>
From out of the waterfall itself, right through the
veil of falling water, came Sounding Sea, shaking
himself like a dog after a plunge.  He climbed upon
the ledge, took a step or two upon the back track,
and then, with a gesture of annoyance, turned again
and walked out of sight through, or under, the fall.
</p>

<p>
'He has forgotten something,' said Terence.  'After him!'
</p>

<p>
Careless of risk, they passed the falling curtain
and hurried on the track of Sounding Sea, who was
moving slowly through a natural tunnel, the mouth of
which gaped blackly at his pursuers.  Had the Maori
not lit a torch the comrades could have done nothing
but await his return.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly Terence swung back an arm and barred
George's advance, for the tunnel took a turn, widening
into a cave.  Peering round the angle, they saw
Sounding Sea, his torch set down, searching for
something he appeared to have dropped.
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-194"></a>
<br />
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-194.jpg" alt="The tunnel took a turn, widening into a cave (page 194)." />
<br />
The tunnel took a turn, widening into a cave (page 194).
</p>

<p>
But there was something else.  Something which
brought George's teeth together with a click, and
caused Terence to clench his fists.
</p>

<p>
Stretched upon a mat, his wrists and ankles bound,
and further secured by a rope round his middle,
which was attached to an iron bar let into the floor
of the cave, lay Paeroa, while a few feet from him
was Kawainga, much in the same case, save that her
feet were free.
</p>

<p>
Even in that light it could be seen that the unhappy
pair looked miserably weak and ill, though scraps of
food and a bowl of water showed that starvation had
not been added to their other tortures.
</p>

<p>
Terence felt the arm he held quivering in his grip.
Indeed, George restrained himself with difficulty;
for the sight of the poor sufferers set his blood
aflame, and another black mark was added to the
long tally against Te Karearea.
</p>

<p>
Just then Sounding Sea spoke.  'Where is my
<i>mere</i>, O Paeroa?  It was in my belt when I fed
you.'  He made a dive and drew a wooden <i>mere</i> from
the folds of the scanty mat upon which Paeroa lay.
'Pig!' he vociferated.  'Would you steal my club?
Were it not that Te Karearea ordered me to keep
you alive, I would dash out your traitor's brains.
As it is&mdash;take this!'
</p>

<p>
He raised his heavy, sharp-angled club, dwelling
upon his aim for the downstroke, which would have
smashed the shoulder-girdle and left the arm useless
for all time, when with a low growl of rage George
leaped across the intervening space and flung himself
upon the cowardly ruffian.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap19"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XIX
<br /><br />
PAEROA'S VENGEANCE
</h3>

<p>
So utterly unexpected was the attack, that Sounding
Sea went down with a yell of terror; but, quickly
recognising his adversary, he began to wriggle and
twist, clawing and spitting like an angry cat.  But
he could do nothing against such a stalwart as
George, and Terence, confident of this, busied himself
in cutting the bonds of the captives and gently
chafing their swollen joints, while he smiled into
their wan faces, and spoke hopefully in a language
they did not understand of the good time coming for
them.
</p>

<p>
But hope is translatable into any tongue, and, as
Terence chatted on, the dull eyes brightened and a
responsive grin overspread Paeroa's drawn face,
while Kawainga's lips quivered, and she burst into
happy, soothing tears.
</p>

<p>
This was too much for Terence.  His alluring smile
vanished, and he rose and solemnly punched the head
of Sounding Sea.  'I don't often hit a man when he
is down,' he remarked, returning to his patients; 'but
you deserve a taste of your own sauce.'
</p>

<p>
'Quite right,' agreed George.  'Wait here, Terence,
while I get my flask.  When I return, we can settle
what to do.'
</p>

<p>
He was back in a very short time, and the flask,
which he had not opened since he left Sydney, came
in usefully now; for the strong spirit, dashed with
water, soon restored Paeroa and Kawainga, who sat
up and began to talk.
</p>

<p>
'I did what I could, Hortoni,' Paeroa said sadly.
'Had you met me by the fork that day all would
have been well.  As it is, I have still one word of the
white-haired chief to you.  Te Karearea took the
other.  Here it is.'
</p>

<p>
Like all the Hau-haus, he wore his hair long, and
now he pulled from the tangled locks a soiled piece
of paper, which he held out to George, who took it
and read aloud:
</p>

<p>
'We ar~ on your t~ack.  Try ~~~~~~scape ~nd meet
us.  Y~~rs&mdash;M. Cra~sto~n.'
</p>

<p>
Here and there the pencilled letters were obliterated;
but the meaning was clear enough.  The question
was&mdash;had Te Karearea driven back, or annihilated the
relief force?  And this, of course, Paeroa could not tell.
</p>

<p>
'I wonder what was in the note which Te Karearea
took,' said George.
</p>

<p>
'Paeroa has made a mistake,' commented Terence.
'Colonel Cranstoun is not white-haired, unless he has
changed since I saw him.'
</p>

<p>
'Well, there is no use worrying over a mistake,'
said George.
</p>

<p>
'Oh, of course not,' agreed Terence, looking
curiously at his friend.  He had his own idea as to
the identity of the writer of the missing note, and
thought that George's ignorance was bliss, in so far
as it saved him from much anxiety.
</p>

<p>
Briefly, Paeroa's story was that, on the march to
rejoin the main body, he had stolen away at the risk
of his life, worked round to the rear of the Arawa
contingent, and presented himself at the British
camp, where he found Colonel Cranstoun and others,
to whom he told the story of George's adventures as
far as he knew them.  He was ignorant of the
capture of Terence, so he could not remove the
impression which existed that the Irishman had
been killed while endeavouring to deliver Captain
Westrupp's note.  Promising to do all he could for
George, Paeroa departed with two short letters in
his care.  He failed, as we know, to communicate
with George on the day of the fight with the Arawas;
but, just before the skirmish, while plotting with
Kawainga to deliver the letters unobserved, the two
were suddenly overpowered by a strong guard of
Hau-haus, and conveyed to the <i>pah</i>.  There they were
kept in close confinement, and eventually transferred
to the cave under the waterfall, Sounding Sea being
appointed their gaoler.  The mean and vicious
Hau-hau had amplified the chief's instructions, and
gratified his own malevolent nature by inflicting
upon the prisoners as many hardships as he dared,
short of actually murdering them, so that their
existence since the departure of Te Karearea had
been wretched indeed.
</p>

<p>
'What is to be done now?' queried George, when
Paeroa's story had come to an end.
</p>

<p>
Terence drew his revolver and turned to face
Sounding Sea.  'Let him know, George,' he said
grimly, 'that, unless he tells the whole truth, there
will be a new arrival in Reinga within a minute.'
</p>

<p>
'Stop!' shrieked Sounding Sea in English.  'I will
tell all.  I was to keep these two here until Te
Karearea's return.  I have cared for them and fed
them.  Mercy, great lords!'
</p>

<p>
'We shall soon find out whether he has told the
truth,' said George gravely.  'We must leave him
here, of course&mdash;and you two must also be content
to wait here a little longer.'
</p>

<p>
Paeroa stood up shakily, endeavouring to throw
out his chest.  'Hope is a good medicine,' he said
bravely.  'By the time Hortoni needs my arm it will
be strong enough to strike a blow for him.'
</p>

<p>
As he spoke, Kawainga uttered a weak, wailing
cry.  George and Terence wheeled, but Paeroa, his
hollow eyes gleaming, staggered past them, and
hurled his wasted body full atop of Sounding Sea.
</p>

<p>
Unperceived by the men, the villain had wormed
his way close to Kawainga, intending to finish her
with one stroke of his club; but the girl's scream
spoiled the murderous ruffian's scheme.
</p>

<p>
Sounding Sea, never a strong man, had grown
weak and flabby in consequence of his idle, dissolute
life; but, nevertheless, Paeroa had his work cut out
for him, and the Englishmen, though anxious to let
him have the credit of saving his sweetheart's life,
were prepared to interfere should the contest go
against him.  They thought, of course, that Paeroa
meant simply to secure the fellow, and hold him
while they adjusted the slipped ropes.
</p>

<p>
But Paeroa had no such intention.  Wrought up
to a pitch of fury at the recollection of his wrongs
at this coward's hands, and mad with rage at the
attempt upon the life of his betrothed, his strength
was unnatural.  For one instant he came uppermost
in the struggle; but it was enough.  Glaring wildly
about him, he saw and scooped the wooden club from
the ground, and, without waiting to fasten his grip
upon the handle, brought the triangular edge smashing
down upon the upturned face of Sounding Sea.
The force of the blow spent itself upon the temple,
and with a deep groan the Hau-hau fell back, killed
outright by that terrible stroke.
</p>

<p>
'Ha!' Paeroa gasped, floundering to his feet and
shaking the bloodstained club.  'Ha!  I have slain a
<i>taipo</i>.  The strength of ATUA was in me.'  Then
he lurched forward like a drunken man, and crashed
down at Kawainga's feet.
</p>

<p>
Horrified, George and Terence gazed at the swift,
awful scene.  It is no light matter to see a man
slain before your eyes.  Moved by a common impulse,
they reverently lifted the dead man and carried him
to one side, while Kawainga fussed and crooned over
Paeroa.
</p>

<p>
'If any one is aware of his visits here, and knows
that he was employed to watch us&mdash;&mdash;' began George;
but Terence struck in:
</p>

<p>
'We are armed now, and with revolvers, not to
speak of your greenstone club.  By the way, why
didn't you bring it with you?'
</p>

<p>
'I did,' answered George, clapping his hand to his
side.  But the loop in his belt was empty.  The <i>mere</i>
was gone.
</p>

<p>
Startled, George looked about the cave; but
nowhere could he find the club.
</p>

<p>
'I fear it has dropped into the river as I came
down the ladder,' he said.  'Wait here, if you don't
mind, Terence, and I will go and see if I have left it
in our hut.  No; let me go, for if I meet any one,
my knowledge of the language will get me past him,
whereas you might be stopped.'
</p>

<p>
'Bring back the basket of food with you,' Terence
called after him as he hurried away.
</p>

<p>
As he rapidly ascended the ladder, George became
conscious of an extraordinary commotion in the <i>pah</i>.
Shouts and cries, wailing of <i>teteres</i>, even gun-shots,
disturbed the quiet night, and, wondering what had
happened, he scaled the palisades and sped to his
<i>whare</i>.
</p>

<p>
A glance all round told him that the club was not
there, so, snatching up the basket of food, he was
about to set off again, when from the confusion of
sounds in the direction of the <i>marae</i>, one detached
itself, clear and high:
</p>

<p>
'<i>Rongo pai!  Rongo pai!</i>' (Good tidings!  Good
tidings!) 'Salutations, O Hawk of the Mountain!
O Slayer of the Pakeha, hail!'
</p>

<p>
Without an instant's pause George turned and ran,
scaling the stockade, and dashing down the
flax-ladder at perilous speed.
</p>

<p>
'Come!' he shouted, when he had gained the entrance
to the cave.  'Out of this for your lives.  Te
Karearea has returned!'
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XX
<br /><br />
A BID FOR LIBERTY
</h3>

<p>
'Up with you!' said George, holding the swaying
ladder.  'Wait on top till we join you.  What a
good thing I had my flask.'
</p>

<p>
It was.  The strong spirit nerved the invalids to
the effort they were obliged to make, and in a few
minutes the four of them were standing on the ledge
outside the <i>pah</i>, and by means of the ladder easily
scaled the palisades.
</p>

<p>
The clamour still continued, and George and
Terence swiftly piloted their exhausted friends to
the fence behind their hut.  Here the ladder came
into play again, and they made for the underground
world, George explaining its peculiarities to Paeroa
as they sped along.
</p>

<p>
'You will be safe enough if you do not wander
far from the entrance,' he assured the Maori.  'We
will manage to visit you before long.'
</p>

<p>
They left the basket of food and the flask with
the refugees, and, still hurrying, for every minute
was precious now, reached the shelter of their <i>whare</i>
without encountering any of the Hau-haus.
</p>

<p>
'Have you found your club?' Terence asked,
carefully bestowing cartridges in his various
pockets.
</p>

<p>
'No,' George answered gloomily.  'I must have
dropped it last night between the fence and the
underground world.  The strange part of it is that
I should not have missed it till just now.'
</p>

<p>
'The thing is always generating mysteries,' grumbled
Terence.  'I hope we shall find it, though; for
it may make all the difference between life and
death to us.'
</p>

<p>
'You are right,' said George, who seemed much
upset.  'Of course I do not agree with you that
there is anything supernatural about the club; but
still&mdash;but still&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
Terence's eyes grew round.  'You don't agree with
me!  Why, you old humbug, when did I say that the
thing had any supernatural power?'
</p>

<p>
'You talked of the English lack of imagination,'
George replied stiffly.
</p>

<p>
Terence laughed.  'The most wonderful thing
about that blessed club is that it has twice brought
you and me to the brink of a dispute.  I really
believe&mdash;&mdash;  Hullo!  Here he is.'
</p>

<p>
Unheard and unannounced, as usual, Te Karearea
had entered.  A grim smile, quickly suppressed,
parted his thin lips for an instant, and he bent a
frowning gaze upon George, who, angered out of
himself at the loss of his <i>mere</i> and the memories
which the sight of the chief recalled, had sprung
to his feet and was glaring defiantly at the
intruder.
</p>

<p>
'Salutations, friends!' said Te Karearea coldly.
'You did not meet me at the gate, so I have come
to&mdash;&mdash;'  He interrupted himself, his furtive eyes
gleaming.  'Where is the <i>mere</i> of TUMATATJENGA,
Hortoni?  It hangs not at your side.'
</p>

<p>
George made no answer; for it was important to
ascertain whether the chief had come straight from
the <i>marae</i>, or had already visited the hut and
discovered their absence.  Familiar with his friend's
lightest change of expression, Terence knew that
the storm was ready to break, and dropped his hand
lightly upon the revolver in his coat pocket, through
which he covered the chief.  If treachery were
intended, it was as well to be prepared.
</p>

<p>
'Speak, Hortoni!'  Te Karearea's tone was imperative
to the point of insolence.  His scarred face
looked terrible under his malignant scowl.
</p>

<p>
There was a steely glint in George's eyes, and his
nostrils quivered; but his voice was fairly calm as
he answered: 'A man may do as he likes with his
own.  If I have smashed the <i>mere</i> among the rocks,
or thrown it into the river, what is it to you?  You
chatter like a parrot, and with as little sense.  Leave
us.  We wish to sleep.'
</p>

<p>
But Te Karearea had sense enough, and whatever
black design he had in his mind when he entered
the hut, he put it away for the time, until he should
discover the truth about the <i>mere</i>.  So, to the
surprise of his hearers, instead of flying into a rage, he
grinned genially at them.
</p>

<p>
'You are right, Hortoni,' he said.  'It is only
children who talk when they are tired, and quarrel
till they fall asleep.  I, too, am weary and would
rest.  Perhaps you will be in a better mind to-morrow,
and will show me the <i>mere</i> of TUMATAUENGA.  I
will go, since you have nothing to say to me.  Unless,
indeed, you wish to renew your parole,' he finished
with a sneer.
</p>

<p>
A sudden, inexplicable impulse swayed George.
</p>

<p>
'Stay, O Hawk of the Mountain,' he said, and
all appearance of anger left him.  'For a moon
past you have kept us here by means of a trick.
You caught us in a trap of our own making.  Now
shall there be no more tricks, and, lest you go away
again in the night, leaving us fast here, I tell you to
your face&mdash;you yourself and none other&mdash;we take
back our word.'
</p>

<p>
For once in his life Te Karearea had received a
setback.  His usual coolness deserted him, and his ready
tongue tripped as he asked if he had heard aright.
</p>

<p>
'Does this mean that you will try to escape,
Hortoni?' he inquired, when both George and
Terence had repeated their decision.  He moved
backwards towards the door as if he feared an
immediate attack.
</p>

<p>
'Why not?' George answered coolly.  'We have
told you that we do not wish to stay here, yet you
will not let us go.  Now we will go whether you
will allow us or not.'
</p>

<p>
But Te Karearea had recovered his equanimity.
'When?' he inquired, with an air of great simplicity.
</p>

<p>
George laughed.  'It is enough for you to know
that we will go.'
</p>

<p>
'When the gates of Reinga are shut, why seek to
open them, Hortoni?  Take time to think,' suggested
the chief.
</p>

<p>
'It is time to act,' retorted George, and Terence,
informed of his friend's sudden resolution, nodded
assent.
</p>

<p>
Te Karearea was puzzled.  Sly and designing
himself, he could appreciate straightforwardness in
others; yet he could not believe that his captives
would have taken such a stand unless there was
something underlying their conduct of which he was
ignorant.  Meantime, confident of his ability to
prevent their escape, he temporised.
</p>

<p>
'Nevertheless, I give you time for thought, my
friends,' he said.  Then, being a superb actor, he
stopped on the threshold.  'If you will, I can set my
young men to look for your <i>mere</i> in the morning,
Hortoni,' he suggested graciously.
</p>

<p>
'Have I said that it was lost?' George countered
quickly.  'But, if it were, did your young men find
it when it dragged itself from your hand and flew
into the sea?  Have you yet to learn, O Te Karearea,
that my God has given me the <i>mere</i> to stand between
me and death?'
</p>

<p>
Te Karearea was silenced.  Muttering a charm, he
slid through the door, which presently was blocked
outside.  Terence put his ear to the wall and could
hear the shuffling of naked feet, as if a number of
men were dispersing.  He turned to his friend.
</p>

<p>
'If the <i>mere</i> had been in your belt, George, I
believe that the chief would have taken chances
and attacked you to gain possession of it.  He had a
dozen men outside.  But its absence puzzled him.
Am I far wrong in saying that, either by its presence
or its absence, the greenstone club is for ever coming
between you and death?'
</p>

<p>
'Even as I said to Te Karearea,' agreed George.
'Yes; old Te Kaihuia's gift was nothing short of a
providence.  What are we to do now?  I had no
idea of taking back our parole so suddenly; but
something seemed to force me to do it.  You don't
object?'
</p>

<p>
'I should say not.  The sooner we are out of here
the better.  I didn't like the look in the Hawk's eyes.'
</p>

<p>
'I hope we shall be out of it before dawn,' said
George.  'When the chief once realises that the <i>mere</i>
is gone, things will happen quickly.  You may be
sure it was not simply for the pleasure of greeting
us that he came here to-night.  He was in a black
mood, and I suspect, if the truth were known, he has
been well hammered by our people.'
</p>

<p>
'More power to them!' cried Terence.  'You are
right, George; it is time to quit.  I am not sure
whether the chief takes us seriously; but he has left
a guard at the door.'
</p>

<p>
'Only one?' asked George, and Terence nodded.
'I have a plan in the rough,' he went on, looking
at his watch.  'It is just eleven.  The sentry will
probably be changed at two or three o'clock.  We
will divide that time between watching and resting.
If we are quiet, sentry number one will give a good
account of us.  Then, an hour or so later&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'We must dispose of number two.'  Terence filled
in the pause.
</p>

<p>
'I am afraid so,' said George regretfully.  'Our
lives hang in the balance, and the lives of many
others as well.  We will avoid extreme measures if
possible.  I wish I had my club.  The very sight of
it would frighten the fellow into submission.'
</p>

<p>
Terence looked up at the roof and grinned.  'I
am waiting to see if your genii, <i>taipos</i>, <i>taniwhas</i>, or
whoever are the slaves of the greenstone club, will
bring it back to you the instant you express a wish,'
he said.  'There is a smack of Aladdin and his lamp
about the thing.  Well, what next?'
</p>

<p>
'We must scale the fence behind the <i>whare</i>,'
answered George, smiling.  'The sentries are stationed
at intervals along the platform, and we must manage
to dodge the nearest.  We'll manage it&mdash;we <i>must</i>.'
</p>

<p>
'I'll take the first watch,' said Terence.
</p>

<p>
'No; I will, in case there is any talking to be done.
I wish that we had another basket of food.  It may
go hard with us in the bush.  Lie down and sleep
while you may, old fellow.'
</p>

<p>
Terence drew his mat over him as he lay upon his
bed of fern, and with the readiness of a bushman
dropped asleep, while George sat with his knees
drawn up to his chin, thinking out details and
planning, as far as he could beforehand, to meet
developments.
</p>

<p>
The hours passed, he heard the stealthy footsteps
of the relief, and caught a word or two of the
low-voiced colloquy as the guard made his report.  And
all the time Terence slept comfortably, though the
time for his watch had come and gone.
</p>

<p>
All at once George started, raised his head and
listened intently.  What was that thin, scratching
noise at the back of the hut?  He lightly laid
his hand upon Terence's shoulder, and the
practised bushman was instantly awake, alert and
vigilant.
</p>

<p>
'Some one is cutting through the thatch,' George
breathed into his comrade's ear.
</p>

<p>
This was possible enough.  The roof, which, after
the Maori fashion of architecture, descended within
a few feet of the earth, was thatched with <i>raupo</i>
and other reeds which, though thick, were soft and
might easily be ripped by a sharp knife.  The only
question was the motive of the intruder.
</p>

<p>
Presently a piece of <i>raupo</i>, detached from the
thatch, fell upon the floor.  The visitor, whoever he
was, had penetrated the roof.  George stole to the
widening hole, Terence to the door, and so they
waited, holding their revolvers by the barrel, ready
for whatever might chance.
</p>

<p>
'<i>Hortoni!</i>'  Just the whispered word; but George's
heart leaped, for the voice was Paeroa's, and he
knew that his faithful ally, and not an enemy, stood
without.
</p>

<p>
'I am here, O Whispering Wind,' he breathed back.
'Why&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Hush!  Speak not, Hortoni.  Do you and Mura
take these knives and widen the hole.  I will return.'
</p>

<p>
Presently, as they ripped and cut, the Maori
returned and whispered with his mouth at the hole:
'Te Taroa, whom the Hawk set to guard you, is
asleep.  Hasten, Hortoni, for there are evil spirits
in the air, and Life and Death contend which shall
have you.'
</p>

<p>
Hurriedly he told them how he had come back to
the entrance of the underground world, vaguely
suspecting mischief, and found it blocked.  Alarmed,
he had fetched Kawainga, wormed a way out, and sent
the girl down the hill to the flax-patch on the west.
Then he had crept under the stockade and learned
from the chatter of the sentries that Te Karearea
had suffered a crushing defeat and had fled to the
<i>pah</i> to renew his supplies and ammunition.  Further,
he learned of the loss of the greenstone club, the
withdrawal of the prisoners' parole, and, knowing
well the consequences to Hortoni if the <i>mere</i> were
really gone, had scaled the palisades in order to urge
his friends to escape without loss of time.
</p>

<p>
The hole in the roof being now wide enough for
them to pass through, Terence very unwillingly went
first.  George was half-out and half-in when a
sneeze was heard in front of the hut, followed by a
yawn and the comfortable grunt of a man stretching
himself.  Te Taroa was awake, and, more, was
coming round the hut, as though to atone for his
carelessness.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly he stopped, every keen sense alert, and
sprang back, open-mouthed; but, before he could
yell an alarm, the butt of Terence's revolver crashed
down upon his head, and he fell back stunned.
</p>

<p>
George was now out, and by Paeroa's directions
he and Terence removed their boots, lest they should
clatter as they climbed the palisades.  The Maori
went first, then Terence passed down the boots and
swung himself over, and, lastly, George jumped on
to the platform and laid his hands on the top of the
stockade.
</p>

<p>
Ten seconds more and he would have been over,
but, as he straddled the fence, the roar of a gun at
close-quarters and the 'wheep' of a bullet past his
head so startled him that he lost his balance and fell
headlong.  But, instead of rolling into the ditch he
banged against the fence and remained suspended
there, unable for the moment to free himself.  His
sock had caught upon a projecting stake near the
top of the stockade.
</p>

<p>
'Run!' he gasped.  'I'm after you.'
</p>

<p>
Not suspecting his plight, Paeroa and Terence
sped towards the upper bridge, while a number
of Hau-haus clambered over the fence, leaped, or
floundered through, the ditch, and hurried away in
blind pursuit.  For the night was very dark.
</p>

<p>
George's peculiar position undoubtedly saved his
life, for the Hau-haus deemed him far ahead; so,
when the chase had swept by, he reversed his
uncomfortable attitude and dropped into the ditch.
</p>

<p>
Not caring to run any more risks, he laid his
revolver on the top of the bank before climbing out;
but, he had scarcely begun to move when a Maori
swung over the stockade and landed fairly on top of
him.
</p>

<p>
The yell died in the man's throat as George grappled
with him, forcing him back against the sloping side
of the ditch with one hand, while he groped for his
revolver with the other.  But he had been dragged
somewhat to one side in the short, sharp struggle,
and the weapon eluded his grasp.  The Hau-hau
turned and twisted, striking ineffectual blows; but
he had no chance against George, whose groping
hand presently encountered a long, hard stone just
below the edge of the ditch.
</p>

<p>
'This will do,' he thought, and laid the man out
with a well-directed blow.  Then down he went on
his hands and knees to search for his revolver.
Realising how important it was that he should find
it, he drew a match from his pocket and, covering it
with his hat, struck it against the stone which he
still held in his hand.
</p>

<p>
For an instant it flickered, and then flared up.
But George, careless of his exposed situation, knelt,
staring with wide, almost frightened, eyes at the
greenstone club, which he held once again in his
hands.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXI
<br /><br />
IN THE FLAX SWAMP
</h3>

<p>
Loth as George was to yield to the superstitious
feeling which the coincidences in connection with
the greenstone club invariably engendered, he was
almost stupefied at its reappearance at the present
juncture.  Yet there was nothing supernatural about
it.  He had jumped into the ditch almost at the exact
point at which the <i>mere</i> had dropped from his belt,
and had naturally stumbled upon it.  He was too
well balanced to remain long under the spell of
the occurrence, and with a sigh of thankfulness
picked up the club, stripped the mat from the
shoulders of the unconscious Maori, and ran, light-footed,
in the direction of the upper bridge.  Before
he had gone twenty yards he bounced into a number
of Maoris hurrying towards the same spot.
</p>

<p>
'Have you caught them?' he said thickly,
congratulating himself that the darkness and the mat
about his shoulders would prevent immediate
recognition.
</p>

<p>
'<i>No hea?</i>' grumbled a Hau-hau.  The words, meaning
literally 'from whence?' imply in Maori phraseology
that the thing inquired for is nowhere.  It
was an admission that the superstitious fellows did
not expect to retake the fugitives.
</p>

<p>
'Hortoni, indeed, is under the protection of
TUMATAUENGA,' growled another.  'Else would the Hawk
have slain him ere now.'
</p>

<p>
'But Hortoni has lost the <i>mere</i>&mdash;so they say,'
returned George, quickening his pace a little, so as
to pass the talkative Maori.
</p>

<p>
'<i>Na!</i> the <i>mere</i> of TUMATAUENGA cannot be lost,'
a third observed sententiously as George drew ahead
of him.  'By this time Hortoni again wears it by his
side.  <i>Ehara!</i>  It is extraordinary, and I do not know
why ATUA should favour a Pakeha.  But so it is.
<i>Ea!</i>' he grunted disgustedly.  'In my opinion
Hortoni is a god.  Who can prevail against a
god?'
</p>

<p>
The first part of this speech was so true that
George felt once more that curious thrill which had
so often affected him when the greenstone club was
in question.  The last part shocked him and, forgetful
of his assumed character, he impetuously contradicted
the astounded speaker.
</p>

<p>
'Fool!  I am no god,' he cried.  'There is but one
God, the God of the Pakehas, and He&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
The next moment he was flying for his life across
the tree bridge and down the hill, while the Maoris,
ignoring in their turn his presumed divinity,
scampered after him, their yells blending with the shouts
of those who had already reached the plain.
</p>

<p>
Stumbling and slipping, George dashed along the
track, bruising himself badly against a hundred
obstacles, but grimly silent lest by any outcry he
should drag his friends back into danger.  Far
behind him he could hear the voice of the arch-liar
Te Karearea calling to him that the greenstone club
had been found, and that all would be well if he
would return.  Once he collided with a Hau-hau
who rose suddenly from behind a boulder; but his
ready wit saved him, and the two ran side by side to
the bottom of the hill, where George branched off to
the right.
</p>

<p>
'Go that way, my friend, and I will go this,' he
cried.  'We will meet at the bridge and scoop in the
Pakehas as with a net.'
</p>

<p>
He spoke loudly now, confident that his friends
were safe, and hoping thus to convey to them the
assurance of his own escape.
</p>

<p>
Just then the cry of the <i>weka</i> arose almost under
his feet, and George thought for a moment that he
had disturbed a real bird, so natural was the startled
note.  The next, he remembered the signal they had
agreed upon in case of separation, answered it, and
instantly felt his arm grasped by some one who rose
apparently out of the ground beside him.
</p>

<p>
'<i>He!  He!</i>'  Paeroa's voice sounded the note of
caution and alarm.  'This way, Hortoni.  Into the
flax.  Quick!'
</p>

<p>
Hard upon his brown friend's heels followed George,
treading cautiously upon the rough track of <i>manuka</i>[<a id="chap21fn1text"></a><a href="#chap21fn1">1</a>]
which ran more or less interruptedly across the
swampy ground in which the flax-bushes flourished.
More than once his foot encountered bubbling ooze
and slime; but Paeroa's hand was ever ready to help
him over these gaps, and for a hundred yards or so
they went along without serious mishap.  Then the
shouts and cries which came from scattered points
about the plain seemed to concentrate in one long
yell of triumph, a noisy hubbub arose at the point
where the <i>manuka</i> pathway began, and a spattering
volley followed them as they stumbled forward.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap21fn1"></a>
[<a href="#chap21fn1text">1</a>] <i>Leptospermum scoparium.</i>
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
'They are after us,' panted George, swerving
involuntarily as a bullet smacked into a flax-bush a
few inches from him; but Paeroa whispered a hurried
instruction and, even as another small hail of balls
whimpered past, they leaped from the track into the
heart of a flax-bush, thence into the midst of a
second, out of that into a third, where George
crouched, struggling fiercely to quiet his rough,
laboured breathing, while Paeroa with a last
encouraging word, slipped into a bush a little further
on and squatted there.
</p>

<p>
With one hand grasping the stiff, upstanding leaves,
and with the other fast closed about the handle of
his club&mdash;the loop of which he had taken the precaution
to secure round his wrist&mdash;George sat listening
to the murmur of voices coming gradually nearer.
As far as he could judge there were only two or
three Maoris on the track, whence he argued that the
commotion at the other end had been merely a <i>ruse
de guerre</i> to induce the fugitives to believe that they
were discovered.  Still, it would not do to be too
sure, for the Hau-haus were all over the place, and
it might well be that while some advanced along
the track, others were creeping through the swamp,
searching each bush in turn.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly there fell a silence.  The men on the
manuka had either stopped to reconnoitre or given
up the search and gone back, and George, feeling
cramped and stiff, was about to change his position,
when a low '<i>he! he!</i>' from Paeroa warned him to
remain still.  A moment later a Maori leaped from
the track into a flax-bush, searched it swiftly, and
passed on to another.
</p>

<p>
The sound indicated that the man was coming in
his direction, and George ardently wished that he
had continued to hunt for his revolver, instead of
gazing, moonstruck, at the greenstone club.  Another
leap and the man was in the clump next to him.
One more and&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
A stream of fire, the roar of a revolver, and with
a loud, choking gasp the Hau-hau fell dead
somewhere in the ooze, while from the adjoining bush
came Terence's voice: 'Quick, George, after me!  We
are close to the spot where the river forks.  Kawainga
is already across.  I came back for you.'
</p>

<p>
Amid the tumult of pursuit, crackling rifle fire and
yells, as now and again an incautious Maori floundered
into the swamp, they left their cover and leaped
from bush to bush across the space between the
broken end of the track and the small strip of hard
ground by the river.  Here Paeroa joined them and,
guided by him, they crossed the stream and plunged
into the bush.

</p>

<p>
'Safe!' muttered Terence.  'I had to shoot that
fellow, George, for he landed almost on top of me.
I don't think that they will find us now; but we had
better get away as far as possible before we halt.
We are not out of the wood yet.'
</p>

<p>
'Very much in it, I should say,' answered George,
as a thorn-branch smacked him sharply across the
cheek.  'Don't go too fast, Paeroa.  It will not do
for us to lose touch with one another.  Besides, you
must be almost worn out.  Where is Kawainga?'
</p>

<p>
'Here I am, Hortoni,' said the girl.  'I waited for
you on the flat with Paeroa, though you did not see
me.'  There was a note of pride in her voice.
</p>

<p>
'You are both good friends, I know,' replied George.
'Are you weary, Star of the Morning?'
</p>

<p>
'Nay; the Maori is never weary when a friend is
in danger,' the girl answered simply.  'Press on,
Hortoni.  Day is very near.'
</p>

<p>
'Ay!  It must be,' put in Terence.  'Hark, George,
those fellows are still roaring under the impression
we have been kind enough to wait for them in the
swamp.  I can't understand why that astute chief
did not order torches to be lit.'
</p>

<p>
'Possibly because he found out that we had got
possession of firearms, and did not wish to give us
a good target.  By the way, Terence, have you
got the third revolver?  I lost mine as I crossed the
ditch.  My club is all very well; but&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Your club!' Terence's tone expressed amazement.
'You don't mean to say that the thing has
come back to you!'
</p>

<p>
'No; I don't.' George laughed a little.  'However,
I have found it.  It was on the bank of the ditch
where we crossed after our last excursion.'
</p>

<p>
'Oh yes; that sounds quite commonplace,' said
Terence.  'All the same I'll warrant that you were
mightily surprised when you found it.'
</p>

<p>
'I was; and thankful too,' admitted George.  'But
you see how easily everything in connection with
the club may be explained when once we begin to
sift matters.'
</p>

<p>
'I should like to know, then, how it found its way
back to you from the bottom of the sea,' Terence said
slyly.
</p>

<p>
'It was I who brought it back, O Mura.'  Paeroa's
voice came out of the gloom ahead of them.  'I
found it the first time that I dived, and, as I had
been too hurried to take off my waist-cloth, I hid
the <i>mere</i> therein and waited till I could give it to
Hortoni.  But he was sleeping with his face towards
the gates of Reinga, so I slipped it under his mats
as he lay on his litter&mdash;and after that he got well,' he
finished innocently.
</p>

<p>
Terence drew a long breath.  'Another illusion
gone!' he commented.  'Before we are done we
shall be forced to believe that the wonderful <i>mere</i> is
only a piece of common greenstone after all.  I think
that we should halt.  What do you say, Paeroa?'
</p>

<p>
'Let us rest.  The poor fellow must be worn out,'
put in George.  'I feel tired enough myself, now
that the hot excitement has died down.'.
</p>

<p>
After crossing the stream they had turned sharply
to the left and struck into the blazed track which
Te Karearea's axe-men had made on the night of
their arrival.  Otherwise they would not have been
able to get through the thick bush, and must have
fled through the forest by the beaten track, along
which the Hau-haus even now trailed like so many
dogs on the scent of a fox.  As it was, their progress
had been difficult enough, for the undergrowth had
renewed itself in the intervening weeks, and their
low-voiced conversation came in disjointed sentences
as they struggled through the tangle of fern and
creeper which strove to hinder their steps.
</p>

<p>
'Now, listen to me, all of you,' George said earnestly,
as they gratefully stretched themselves on the fern
and divided the food which Kawainga had carried.
'As soon as it is dawn Te Karearea will organise a
hunt for us.  If any of us should be captured, those
who escape must not think of the plight of their
friends, but hurry on to the camp of the British or
the Friendlies.  It is important that this nest of
rebels should be cleared out.  Is that agreed, Terence?
Do you understand, Paeroa?'
</p>

<p>
After some hesitation Terence muttered 'Agreed!'
and Paeroa, who had waited for him to speak first,
answered, 'I hear, Hortoni!' and George was satisfied,
knowing that with him to hear was to obey.
</p>

<p>
As Terence had had most sleep at the beginning of
the night, he now took the first watch and, as the
grey dawn stole through the bush in ghostly, almost
ghastly silence, he thought how different it all was
from Australia, where the morning would have been
heralded in by the beautiful matin-hymn of the
magpie, so called, the cheerful hoot of the laughing-jackass,
and the exquisite treble and alto of hundreds
of smaller birds.  Here was nought but solitude and
stillness&mdash;a stillness so profound that it began to
get upon Terence's nerves, and he more than once
stretched out his hand towards George; for the sense
of companionship was somehow greater if he only
touched his friend's coat&mdash;or so he thought.
</p>

<p>
Presently the sky grew lighter, and the outlines of
various objects began to appear.  Right ahead of
him, a quarter of a mile away, was the hill where
George and he had lain and watched the Hau-haus
at their weird and blasphemous rites.  Down that
hill and through this very bush they had run until
pulled up by that tumble into the underground
world.  If he could only find that hole again!
Why should he not try?  The desire grew with the
idea.
</p>

<p>
'I believe I could find it,' he said within himself,
rising and stretching his arms above his head.  Then
in the midst of a satisfying yawn he dropped noiselessly
out of sight behind the tree against which he
had been sitting.
</p>

<p>
From a hundred different points, ahead and on
each side of him, brown forms were dodging from
tree to tree, and from as many different spots among
the fern scarred, brown faces peered, as it seemed,
malevolently at him.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXII
<br /><br />
THE DOOM OF THE HOUSE OF TE TURI
</h3>

<p>
Terence opened his mouth to shout a warning to
the sleepers to be up and away, but, his bush training
coming to his aid, he shut it with a snap.
</p>

<p>
'I don't think that they have seen me,' he thought;
'but it is too late to run now, at all events.'
</p>

<p>
He wondered why the advancing Maoris should
exercise such caution when, apparently, not a foe
was near.  'It must be their way,' he concluded; 'and
as one never knows when&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
The unspoken words jumbled in his brain and his
eyes grew round.  Two of the Maoris, crawling from
point to point, had suddenly and instantaneously
disappeared, heads down and heels up.
</p>

<p>
'They have found it!' Terence muttered grimly.
'What a nuisance.'  He laid his hand on George's
shoulders, who at once opened his eyes, but lay
perfectly still, mutely questioning.
</p>

<p>
'Maoris!' whispered Terence.  'The fern is full
of them, and two of them have tumbled into our
underground world.'
</p>

<p>
'Bother take them!' murmured George.  'Let me
have a look.'
</p>

<p>
He peered over the tall fern at a group of Maoris
who were standing up beside the spot at which their
comrades had so mysteriously vanished, and with
grave gestures and puzzled frowns were discussing
the new situation.  Their faces cleared and they
grinned at one another as muffled voices from
below assured them that neither <i>taipo</i> nor <i>taniwha</i>
had swallowed their friends.  Then they bent down
over the tangled mass of creepers and held a colloquy
with the imprisoned ones.
</p>

<p>
'They evidently know nothing about the place,'
whispered George.  'How unfortunate that they
should succeed where we have so often failed.  I
think that we had better wake the others and creep
away into the bush while they are still absorbed
with their find; for&mdash;&mdash;  Oh, good heavens!  Look at
Paeroa!  He is going to his death.'
</p>

<p>
For the Maori, his alert senses stirred by their
low-voiced talk, had awakened, risen to his knees,
and peered over the fern at the newcomers.
</p>

<p>
Even as George spoke he bounded to his feet,
threw his hands above his head and rushed towards
the group of Maoris, shouting: '<i>Arawa!  Arawa!
E tika ana!</i>&mdash;It's all right!&mdash;<i>Ka kitea te wahi i
kimihia mai ai e ratou!</i>&mdash;They have found the place
we were looking for!&mdash;<i>Kapai Arawa!  Kapai Arawa!</i>
Hurrah for the Arawas!'
</p>

<p>
His long hair, dressed Hau-hau fashion, streamed
behind him and, before any one could intervene, he
dashed into the midst of the Arawas.
</p>

<p>
With a gasp of horror George ran for all he was
worth.  If at this last moment Paeroa, the faithful
Paeroa, should be&mdash;&mdash;  The dreadful thought was
lost in the rush.
</p>

<p>
Already Paeroa was overpowered, his weak state
allowing him no possible chance against his stalwart
foes.  Utterly unmindful of the British principle of
sympathy for the under dog, two Arawas held him
by the arms, another grasped his long hair, pulling
his head backwards, while a fourth, with raised club,
was about to dash out his brains.
</p>

<p>
But with a rush George was among them and,
ignoring ceremony, struck right and left with his
fists, upsetting the would-be slayer and those who
held Paeroa as well.  Without an instant's delay
Paeroa scuttled into the bush, pending the
adjustment of the dispute.
</p>

<p>
'Pardon, friends!' George said apologetically,
turning his glance upon two who stood ruefully
rubbing their swollen noses.  'You were about to
kill the wrong man.  That is Paeroa, who brought
word of my captivity.'
</p>

<p>
'And you are Hortoni?' queried a thin, lithe man
who was evidently in command.  None of the Arawas
seemed either surprised or resentful.
</p>

<p>
'It is so,' replied George.  'I have just escaped
with Mura, Kawainga, and Paeroa from the nest of
the Hawk.'
</p>

<p>
'Mura!  If you mean Tereni, he was slain
after the fight at Paparatu,' said the Arawa chief.
</p>

<p>
'No; he is here,' corrected George.  'Te Karearea
meant to kill him that night, but I came up in time
to&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'To stop them from shoving me through the gates
of Reinga,' put in Terence, bobbing up from the
fern and airing his broken Maori.  'I am very much
alive, I assure you, Chief.'  The Arawa leader and
he grinned cheerfully at one another.
</p>

<p>
'Don't you remember me?' went on Terence.
'You are Te Ingoa, who imitated the Hau-hau cry
that night at our bivouac.'
</p>

<p>
'Yes; I remember you, O Tereni,' replied the
Arawa in English.  'You told us of Hortoni, and
how he had run away from the white-haired chief.'
</p>

<p>
"The white-haired chief."  George heard without
understanding.  'What are we to do, O Te Ingoa?'
he asked.  'Even now Te Karearea scours the bush
for us with his young men.'
</p>

<p>
'While he scours the bush, we may clean up the
<i>pah</i>, Hortoni,' the Arawa replied sententiously.  'Two
of my men have fallen down a hole here.  They say
that there is quite a large space, but fear to go on
lest Taniwha should lurk at the other end.  What
am I to do?'
</p>

<p>
'There is indeed a <i>taipo</i> at the other end,' George
answered gravely.  'It is in the form of a Hawk who
devours women and little children.'  Then, as the
Arawa's eyes gleamed with comprehension: 'Let me
lead you through the passage, O Te Ingoa.  The
issue of this hole is close by the <i>Pah</i> of Death, more
than half way up the hill.  There is the upper bridge
to cross, but&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Lead on, Hortoni,' Te Ingoa interrupted excitedly.
'To us shall fall the honour of clipping the Hawk's
talons and blunting his beak.  The rest, with the
white-haired chief, your father, are behind.  I will
send a messenger to hurry them.'
</p>

<p>
George turned to Terence, who was smiling
sympathetically at him.  'Colonel Cranstoun is evidently
not far away,' he said.  'Te Ingoa wishes to march
forward.  But don't you think we ought to wait
until the others come up?'
</p>

<p>
'Decidedly not,' replied Terence.  'Let these fellows
do their own killing.  The white-haired chief, as
they call him, will be better out of this fuss.'
</p>

<p>
'I am not sure that the colonel would agree with
you,' said George.  'Still, there are enough of us
here, and it is a pity to waste valuable lives.'  He
turned to the Arawa.  'The sooner we go the
better, Chief.'
</p>

<p>
'I am ready, Hortoni.  Show us the way.'
</p>

<p>
Without more words George and Terence dropped
into the hole&mdash;more circumspectly than on the first
occasion&mdash;followed by all of the Arawas except three
whom Te Ingoa sent upon the back track.  Also,
by George's order Paeroa and Kawainga remained
behind, for they were thoroughly exhausted by their
exertions.
</p>

<p>
When at last the contingent stood beneath the
exit on the hillside it was precisely six o'clock, an
hour when ordinarily the <i>pah</i> would have been
humming with the bustle of commencing day.  On
this day there was bustle, indeed, but not of the
usual kind.
</p>

<p>
Before disturbing the barricade which Te Karearea
had for some reason placed before the opening, Te
Ingoa, his lieutenants, and the two Pakehas held a
final brief conference.  George was for waiting until
night before delivering the attack, but the Arawa
argued that he would be unable to hold in his men,
who were mad to get to grips with Te Karearea,
whose revolting cruelties had disgraced the name
of Maori.
</p>

<p>
'Then you will suffer terribly,' said George; 'for
the place is extraordinarily strong.'
</p>

<p>
'We shall of course lose a few as we cross the
bridge and rush the walls,' Te Ingoa agreed
coolly.  'That is to be expected.  All the same, the
Hawk's nest shall be harried this time, I promise
you.'
</p>

<p>
'Well, I don't want to be a wet blanket,' said
George, giving in.  'We two will do our best to
help you.'
</p>

<p>
'I am sure of that,' Te Ingoa replied heartily, and
shook hands, English fashion.  'As you and Tereni
know the lie of the land, you had better go out first
and reconnoitre.'
</p>

<p>
It was easy enough to displace the barricade and,
as the boulders were thrown aside and sounds from
the outer world began to penetrate, it was evident
that something out of the common was afoot.  For,
borne upon the morning wind, came the noise of
distant shouting, the snapping crackle of independent
rifle fire, and the short, sullen bark of revolvers.
Then, as George and Terence hurled down the last
obstruction and excitedly pushed through the opening,
the roar of a heavy volley close at hand stunned
their ears, and to their amazement they saw the
plain and hillside alive with men, fighting furiously,
and all, apparently, in the most extraordinary
confusion.
</p>

<p>
'Come out!' shouted George.  'Hold back your
men, though, until you have seen this thing for
yourself.  I can't make it out.'
</p>

<p>
'I think I can,' cried Terence, jumping about in
his excitement as Te Ingoa joined them.  'The main
body of your force has come up on the heels of the
advance and got between Te Karearea's rascals and
the <i>pah</i>.  See&mdash;the walls are almost deserted.'
</p>

<p>
'You are right,' agreed Te Ingoa.  'Those are my
<i>kupapas</i> (volunteer Maoris), and they are settling
accounts with the Hau-haus.'
</p>

<p>
'What are you going to do?' George asked eagerly.
</p>

<p>
'And thus, almost without a blow struck at itself,
falls the <i>Pah</i> of Death,' said Te Ingoa, half to
himself.  He waved his hand downwards.  'Ignorant of
our approach&mdash;he could hardly be careless of it&mdash;Te
Karearea has allowed his men to get out of hand
in his desire to recover the greenstone club.  One
column of my fellows is busy with the remnant of
the garrison, the other is there by the river, blocking
the advance of the returning Hau-haus.  What am
I going to do?  Why, charge down the hill, take
this lot in the rear, and then join column number
two in polishing off the fellows by the river.  I never
expected such an easy job, I must say.'
</p>

<p>
'He talks like an Englishman,' observed Terence,
as the Maori dived below to summon his men, 'and
he feels, like an Irishman, sorry that he won't have
enough fighting.'
</p>

<p>
'He may get as much as he cares for before all is
done,' said George.  'All this is very unlike Te
Karearea.  I suspect a trick.'
</p>

<p>
'Well, down we go!  Here come Te Ingoa and his
merry men.'  The whoop Terence let out would have
done credit to a Comanche.  'Hurrah!  Stick close
to me, George.  I believe the old Hawk has been
caught napping.'
</p>

<p>
It really was so.  The crafty Te Karearea, unsettled
by the escape of his prisoners, and still more so by
the disappearance of the greenstone club, had allowed
his men to get out of hand, and was now paying
heavily for his error.  Perhaps, too, the words of
the old prophecy haunted him, and the hopelessness
of averting the ruin of his house still further
unbalanced him.
</p>

<p>
At any rate, instead of playing tricks and laying
ambuscades, there he was on the hillside, fighting
like a demon.  As the comrades raced down the
slope in advance of Te Ingoa, the desperate Hau-hau
turned his head and saw them, and with a loud
howl of fury sprang through the press and made
straight at them.
</p>

<p>
It was magnificently brave&mdash;one man charging
two hundred&mdash;but the upward rush of the Arawas
to meet Te Ingoa bore back the Hau-haus, and Te
Karearea, shouting hateful words of vengeance, was
swallowed up in the recoiling wave of his own
men.  Another moment and the Arawas, swooping
down the hill, struck their prey, driving them back
upon the weapons of the Arawas below, and the
Hau-haus, like the hard, defiant quartz between the
crushing hammer and the plate, were smashed to
pieces.
</p>

<p>
Armed only with his <i>mere</i>, George was able to do
very little execution, for the Hau-haus who recognised
him gave him a wide berth.  However desperate
a conflict may be with ordinary folk, there is always
a chance of escape; but when it comes to engaging
a wizard armed with a magical club, it is best to
take no chances.
</p>

<p>
The slaughter was terrific, for the combat was in
the old style, hand to hand.  Neither side had had
time to reload, and while some swung their guns
by the barrel, others used their ramrods like rapiers,
thrusting viciously at eyes and throats.  One wretch,
pierced through and through, rushed howling into
the thick of it, the slender steel rod, protruding front
and back, wounding others and barring his own
progress, till he was mercifully slain with a blow
from a bone <i>mere</i>.
</p>

<p>
'Come out of this,' George shouted to Terence, who
was fighting back to back with him.  'It is sickening.
Let us go and help our folk by the river.
These fellows are done for.'
</p>

<p>
'Right!' Terence yelled back, sweeping his clubbed
rifle round to clear a path.  His empty revolver had
long ago been thrown in the grinning face of a
Hau-hau.  'Come on!'  He rushed off, screeching with
excitement, under the impression that his friend was
close behind him.
</p>

<p>
So George had been at the start; but, as he ran,
he heard a shout: 'Turn, Hortoni!  Accursed Pakeha,
I fear neither you nor your <i>mere</i>.  Stop and die!'
</p>

<p>
Without the least desire to accept this gracious
invitation, which resembled that of the famous
Mrs. Brown to the duck, George turned his head to find
Pokeke rushing at him with levelled spear, his eyes
glowing and his mouth agape with hate.
</p>

<p>
That turn nearly cost George his life, for his foot
slipped and he fell heavily on his face.  The long
spear sped to its mark, but much fighting had made
Pokeke's hand unsteady.  He missed George altogether
and, retaining too long his grasp of the shaft,
turned a half somersault and sprawled beside his
intended victim.
</p>

<p>
Both of them were so shaken that they lay still
for some seconds.  Pokeke was up first and, before
George could rise, flung himself upon him, grasping
his hair and drawing back his head, while in his
right hand he raised his wooden <i>mere</i> with which to
give the <i>coup de grâce</i>.
</p>

<p>
Now, if ever, the wonderful greenstone club ought
to have shown its power; but, alas!  George had
fallen with his arm under him, and TUMATAUENGA'S
<i>mere</i> was jammed so tightly beneath his heavy body
that not even the war-god himself could charm it
forth.
</p>

<p>
But, as the wooden club descended, the stock of
a rifle, sweeping horizontally, met it with such
violence as to send it spinning many yards away,
while the brass-shod butt, continuing its swing,
caught Pokeke a frightful blow between the eyes,
crushing in his skull.
</p>

<p>
'Not hurt?' shrieked Terence, whose face was
flaming.  'Come on!'  He lugged George from the
ground.  'Go first!' he screamed, his voice cracking.
'I told you before we left Sydney that I couldn't
trust you out of my sight.'  He was almost mad
with the fierce joy of his first battle.
</p>

<p>
'Where is the Hawk?' he sang out to George as
they ran down the hill.
</p>

<p>
'Somewhere in the thick of it,' panted George.
'Haven't seen him since the start.  Come on!'
</p>

<p>
The combat on the hillside waned to a close; but
as yet there had been no concerted movement
towards the river-bridge, where a much smaller
force of Arawas did battle with an outnumbering
body of Hau-haus.  Still, every now and then an
Arawa from the hill would arrive and take a hand,
so that matters were growing more equal as the
friends came racing across the plain.
</p>

<p>
'Pull up for a moment,' gasped George.  'If we
don't get our wind we shall be brained for a certainty.
Where are the white soldiers and Colonel Cranstoun?&mdash;Oh,
God help us!  Look at that!'
</p>

<p>
With a horrible fear at his heart he hurled himself
towards the bridge, at the far end of which two
Pakehas were defending themselves against a dozen
Hau-haus.  Both were elderly, while the hair of one
was snow-white; but their erect carriage, fearless
demeanour, and the manner in which they wielded
their old-fashioned swords, occasionally getting in
a shot with the revolvers in their left hands, showed
that they were old soldiers, and quite accustomed
to give a good account of themselves.
</p>

<p>
The construction of the bridge gave them an
advantage, and no doubt they could have held their
own against any frontal attack; but what horrified
George and Terence was the sight of Te Karearea,
who with four Hau-haus were hurrying to assail the
two old soldiers from behind.
</p>

<p>
He with his men and George with Terence were
running along two sides of a triangle, the bridge
being the apex.  If the chief reached it first&mdash;No!
George set his teeth and swore he should not.
</p>

<p>
'Father!' he shouted after one long indrawing of
breath.  'Keep at it!  We are behind you!'  For he
feared that the noise of footsteps racing up behind
would disturb the attention of Colonel Haughton
and General Cantor, whose presence there he could
in no way account for.
</p>

<p>
They were indeed the only white men with Te
Ingoa, for Colonel Cranstoun to his great annoyance
had been called south.  But he had set the wheels
in motion, and the friendlies, along with Colonel
Haughton and his brother-in-law, had marched
against the <i>pah</i>.  George had presumed the "white-haired
chief" to be Colonel Cranstoun, never dreaming
that his father and General Cantor had crossed
the sea in chase of him as soon as they learned that
he was in New Zealand.
</p>

<p>
Te Karearea heard George's shout and grinned
at him, shaking his bloodstained <i>mere</i>.  He was
slightly in advance and running like a deer.
</p>

<p>
'Aha!  Hortoni, they told me up there who the
white-haired chief was,' he yelled.  'Give me the
<i>mere</i> of TUMATAUENGA, and I will call off my men.'
</p>

<p>
'Take it, fiend!' shouted George, leaping across
the narrowing apex and aiming a furious blow at
the chief, while Terence and the four Hau-haus raced
for the bridge.  One of them Terence brained with
his rifle, but the other three dodged him and ran on,
while he despairingly toiled after them, knowing
that he would be too late.
</p>

<p>
Then to his intense relief he heard the welcome
'wheep' of bullets past his ears, and first one and
then another of the Hau-haus rolled over, dead or
out of action.  Two minutes more and a strong
party of Arawas under Te Ingoa himself swarmed
round the old soldiers and slew every man of the
Hau-haus who were attacking them.
</p>

<p>
And now it was the turn of Colonel Haughton
and General Cantor to be anxious, for between
George and Te Karearea a fearful combat raged.
The Hau-hau had parried the blow aimed at him,
and the Englishman himself had reeled back before
a fierce counterstroke.  For a moment after they
circled round one another, like two wrestlers seeking
a grip.  Then with a shout they clashed together.
</p>

<p>
Disregarding his <i>mere</i>, which he allowed to hang
from his wrist by its loop, George fastened the
strong fingers of his left hand round the chief's
sinewy throat, while with the other he clutched the
fist that closed round the club and bent the wrist
backwards so unmercifully that with a groan Te
Karearea opened his fingers and let his weapon fall.
Then, writhing free, he flung his arms round George
and strove to throw him.  The <i>mere</i> of TUMATAUENGA
slipped from the dangling wrist and lay
unheeded on the hard ground while the two strong
men fought for the possession of it.
</p>

<p>
Backwards and forwards they rocked and reeled,
locked in what each realised to be a death-grapple,
neither yielding the slightest advantage to the other.
Arawas and whites looked on, amazed, unable to
help their champion, so quick and sudden were the
turnings and twistings of the combatants.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly George quitted his hold.  But before Te
Karearea could utter the yell of triumph which
sprang to his lips, he felt his long hair seized from
behind, his head jerked backwards with a force
which nearly broke his neck, and he fell, dragging
George with him.
</p>

<p>
Over and over they rolled; but George, though he
received some heavy blows in the face, shifted his
grip, but never loosed the hold he had got of that
long black hair.
</p>

<p>
Now his hands were on each side of Te Karearea's
head, his fingers tightened in the coarse locks, and
with a supreme effort he rolled the chief on his back
and flung himself astride of him.  Then, drawing
up the malevolent, grinning face till it was close to
his own, he dashed it from him with terrible force.
</p>

<p>
There was a dull, smacking sound, as if two
stones had been brought together.  A fierce scream,
strangled in its utterance, burst from the chief, and
his eyes gazed ragefully into the stern, flushed face
above him.  Then their baleful light was suddenly
extinguished, the grinning teeth parted, the strong
jaw dropped, the clinging hands fell away.
</p>

<p>
Te Karearea, the back of his skull crushed like an
eggshell against the hard greenstone club, quivered
for an instant and passed through the gates to the
waters of Reinga.
</p>

<p>
The man of "the strange, strong race"&mdash;the race
of the Eagle&mdash;had held to the <i>mere</i> of TUMATAUENGA,
and the doom of the House of Te Turi had fallen.
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
What a lot they had to say to one another that
night, as they sat round the bivouac fire and watched
the flames as they shot up from the stockade and
<i>whares</i>&mdash;for Te Ingoa had not left standing a single
stick of the <i>Pah</i> of Death.  The long day after the
battle was won had worn quickly to an end, for
there was much to do, and those who had come
through the stress of the fight were now gathered
together, resting and celebrating their victory, each
after his own manner.
</p>

<p>
Around one fire sat Colonel Haughton and
George, reconciled for all time, and anxious only
to please one another, Terence and General Cantor,
Kawainga, the faithful Paeroa and the Arawa chief,
Te Ingoa, who listened, absorbed, to the story of
the adventures of the two young Pakehas.  The
greenstone club, of course, came in for a considerable
share of attention, and Terence stoutly
championed its claim to magical powers.
</p>

<p>
'You can't explain how it came to be in your
hand that first night on board the <i>Stella</i>,' he
declared.  'You can't account for the fact that it
got between you and Paeroa's club on the hillside
over there.  You can't ex&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Look here, my son,' struck in George, smiling up
into his father's face, though he addressed Terence,
'the explanation of the whole business lies in four
words&mdash;"the Providence of God."  Each time the
greenstone club came into play was a time of
tremendous excitement, and I have no doubt that I
was too preoccupied to notice what I did or did
not do with regard to it.  So encrusted with legend
is the <i>mere</i> of TUMATAUENGA that, because I cannot
remember exactly what I did each time I used it,
miraculous powers are at once attributed to it.'
</p>

<p>
'So you make out that there was nothing extraordinary
about it at all,' said Terence, disappointed.
'Of course one does not expect miracles nowadays.'
</p>

<p>
'Don't you, my boy?' interposed Colonel Haughton.
'God's providence works miracles on our behalf
almost daily.  Is it not a miracle that, after death
has stared him in the face so often, I should have
my dear son back again?  Was it not a miracle that
when you stood with the rope round your neck
he should come up in time?  Suppose he had not
walked towards the sentry and learned what was
toward.'
</p>

<p>
'You are right, Colonel,' Terence answered, abashed;
'though I did not quite mean what I said.'
</p>

<p>
'A thing is none the less miraculous because you
can sometimes explain it,' remarked General Cantor.
'However, I am sure that both you boys know well
enough to whom you owe your safety, and that you
are not so ungrateful as not to acknowledge His
care for you.'
</p>

<p>
There was silence for a moment, and then Colonel
Haughton said: 'Before we say good-night I want to
tell you two something.  I have bought back Major
Moore's old station, George, and the title-deeds are
made out in the joint names of you and your friend
Terence.'
</p>

<p>
'Father!'  For a moment George could not say
another word.  Then he gripped a hand each of his
father and his friend.  'You could not have pleased
me better,' he cried.  'Thank you, dad, thank you.
Partner, I congratulate you.'
</p>

<p>
'But what have I done to be treated like this?'
objected Terence.  'George saves my life, and I am
rewarded for it.  That seems odd.'
</p>

<p>
'You returned the compliment to-day,' Colonel
Haughton reminded him.  'Your father was my
dear friend, Terence, as you know; and, indeed, I
could give you other good reasons for my action.
But why should I?  The thing is done.'
</p>

<p>
'There, Terence, you must make the best of it,'
said George, laughing.  'Unless, indeed, you don't
feel inclined to chum with me any longer.'
</p>

<p>
Terence gave him an eloquent look and tried to
thank Colonel Haughton.  But he could only press
the old man's hand, so George threw an arm round
his shoulders and led him away.
</p>

<p>
Together they stretched themselves under a great
tree, just as they had done on that other night
when Terence had walked into the grip of the
Hawk.  The flames died down on the summit of the
hill&mdash;the <i>Pah</i> of Death was no more.  The blazing
stars of the south looked down upon the battlefield,
still strewn with relics of the fight.  Here and there
in the bivouac some wounded wretch stirred
uneasily and groaned in his troubled slumber.  But
deep in the fern the friends slept the peaceful sleep
of healthy, happy youth&mdash;youth which can forget
past sorrow as easily as it dreams of coming joy;
and between them lay what George had called 'God's
Providence'&mdash;the greenstone <i>mere</i> of TUMATAUENGA.

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
